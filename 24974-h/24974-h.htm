<h2>LITERATURE</h2>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2>CHAPTER I</h2>

<h3>INTRODUCTION</h3>


<p>It is the purpose of this Manual to present the general
principles on which the teaching of literature is based. It
will distinguish between the intensive and the extensive
study of literature; it will consider what material is suitable
for children at different ages; it will discuss the
reasons for various steps in lesson procedure; and it will
illustrate methods by giving, for use in different Forms,
lesson plans in literature that is diverse in its qualities.
This Manual is not intended to provide a short and easy
way of teaching literature nor to save the teacher from
expending thought and labour on his work. The authors
do not propose to cover all possible cases and leave nothing
for the teacher's ingenuity and originality.</p>


<h3><br />WHAT IS LITERATURE?</h3>

<p>Good literature portrays and interprets human life,
its activities, its ideas and emotions, and those things about
which human interest and emotion cluster. It gives breadth
of view, supplies high ideals of conduct, cultivates the
imagination, trains the taste, and develops an appreciation
of beauty of form, fitness of phrase, and music of
language. The term <i>Literature</i> as used in this Manual<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
is applied especially to those selections in the <i>Ontario
Readers</i> which possess in some degree these characteristics.
Such selections are unlike the lessons in the text-books in
grammar, geography, arithmetic, etc. In these the aim
is to determine the facts and the conclusions to which they
lead. Even in the Readers, there are some lessons of
which this is partly true. For instance, the lesson on
<i>Clouds, Rains, and Rivers</i>, by Tyndall, is such as might
be found in a text-book in geography or science. Here
the information alone is viewed as valuable, and the pupil
will probably supplement what he has learned from the
book by the study of material objects and natural phenomena.
When this lesson is to be studied, the pupil should
be taught not only to understand thoroughly what the
author is expressing by his language, but also to appreciate
the clearness and force with which he has given his
message to the world. The pupil should be called upon
to examine the author's illustrations, his choice of words,
and his paragraph and sentence structure.</p>

<p>Each literature lesson in the Reader has some particular
force, or charm of thought and expression. There
is found in these lessons, not only beauty of thought and
feeling, but artistic form as well. In the highest forms
of literature, the emotional element predominates, and it
should be one to which all mankind, to a greater or less
degree, are subject. It is the predominance of these emotional
and artistic elements which makes literature a
difficult subject to teach. The element of feeling is elusive
and can best be taught by the influence of contagion.
There is usually less difficulty about the intellectual element,
that is, about the meaning of words and phrases,
the general thought of the lesson, and the relation of the
thoughts to one another and to the whole.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span></p>

<h3><br />THE QUALITIES THAT APPEAL
TO CHILDREN AT DIFFERENT AGES</h3>

<p>This is a psychological problem which can be solved
only by a study of the interests and capacities of the
children. These interests vary so greatly and make their
appearance at such diverse periods in different individuals
and in the two sexes, that it is a difficult matter to say
with any definiteness just what qualities of literature
appeal to children at any particular age. Moreover, the
children's environment and previous experiences have a
great deal to do in determining these interests and capacities.
There are, however, certain characteristics of different
periods of childhood which are fairly universal, and
which may, therefore, be taken as guiding, determining
factors in the selection of suitable literature.</p>

<h3><br />JUNIOR FORMS</h3>

<p>1. One of the most striking characteristics of young
children is the activity of their imagination. They endow
their toys with life and personality; they construct the
most fantastic and impossible tales; they accept without
question the existence of supernatural beings. The
problem for the teacher is to direct this activity of imagination
into proper fields, and to present material which will
give the child a large store of beautiful images&mdash;images
that are not only delightful to dwell upon, but are also
elevating and refining in their influence upon character.
The fairy tale, the folk tale, and the fable, owe their
popularity with young children to the predominance of
the imaginative element. The traditionary fairy tales
and folk stories are usually more suitable than those that
appear in teachers' magazines and modern holiday books<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
for children. The hardest thing for the educated mind
to do is to write down to the level of children without
coddling or becoming cynical. The old tales are sincere,
simple, and full of faith. They are not written for children,
but are the romance of the people with whom they
came into existence, and they have stood the test of ages.</p>

<p>The myth is usually not suitable for young children,
as it is a religious story having a symbolic meaning which
is beyond their interpretation. If it is used at all, only
the story in it should be given.</p>

<p>2. Stories of adventure, courage, and the defence of
the helpless appeal very strongly to young children. Even
the cruelties and crudities of <i>Bluebeard</i>, <i>Ali Baba and the
Forty Thieves</i>, and <i>Aladdin and his Wonderful Lamp</i> do
not alarm or repel children very much, owing to their lack
of experience in these matters. Stories based on the love
of the sexes are unsuitable for children of this age,
although it constitutes the chief element in stories for
older people.</p>

<p>3. The child is also interested in stories of simple
games, of animals and birds, and of the material world
on which so much of his happiness depends. These stories
are corrective of the desire which characterizes some children
for too many fairy stories. The fairy story and the
nature story should be alternated, so that the child's interests
may be imaginative without becoming visionary,
and practical without becoming prosaic.</p>

<p>4. Most children have a keen sense of the musical
qualities of verse. The child of two years of age will give
his attention to the rhythm of the nursery rhyme when
the prose story will not interest him. The consideration
and analysis of these musical qualities should be deferred<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
for years; but it is probable that the foundation for a
future appreciation of poetry is often laid by an acquaintance
with the rhymes of childhood.</p>

<p>5. The element of repetition appeals strongly to children.
In this lies the attractiveness of the "cumulative
story", in which the same incident, or feature, or form
of expression is repeated again and again with some slight
modification; for example, the story of <i>Henny Penny</i>, <i>The
Gingerbread Boy</i>, and <i>The Little Red Hen</i>. The choruses
and the refrains of songs are pleasant for this reason.</p>

<p><i>Silverlocks and the Three Bears</i> is an example of a
story that has many attractive features. Silverlocks is an
interesting girl, because she is mischievous and adventurous.
The pupils know a good deal about bears and
wild animals from picture books, stories, and perhaps the
travelling menageries. The bears have all proper names&mdash;Rough
Bruin, Mammy Muff, and Tiny; this gives an air
of reality to the story. The bears speak in short, characteristic
sentences.</p>

<p>Silverlocks runs away from home, goes into the woods,
and finds a lonely house which is the home of the bears.
They are not at home, so she enters. These actions suggest
mystery and adventure.</p>

<p>The construction of the story shows two chief divisions,
with three subdivisions. The second division begins with
the return of the bears. They find the soup has been
tasted, the chairs disturbed, and the beds rumpled; their
conversation is interesting, and their tones characteristic.
Tiny, the little bear, suffers most; he enlists the sympathy
of the children, as he has lost his dinner and his chair is
broken. He discovers Silverlocks, but she escapes and
"never runs away from home any more".<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span></p>

<h3><br />SENIOR FORMS (BOOKS III AND IV)</h3>

<p>1. In these Forms, the pupil's imagination is still
strong, though less fantastic and under better control, and
hence stories involving a large element of imagination
retain their charm at this stage. The myth, and longer
and more involved fairy tales, such as Ruskin's <i>King of
the Golden River</i>, Hawthorne's <i>Wonder Book</i>, and Kingsley's
<i>Greek Heroes</i>, are read with avidity.</p>

<p>2. Stories involving <i>a number of incidents</i> are wonderfully
attractive. This is due to the pupil's instinctive
interest in action and personality. Children are more
deeply interested in persons who <i>do</i> things than in those
who <i>become</i> something else than they were. A description
of some evolution of character very soon palls, but
a stirring tale of heroic deeds exerts a powerful fascination.
This explains the attractiveness of the hero tale,
the story of adventure, and the stirring historical narrative.
The action should have the merit of artistic moderation.
Stories in which there is a carnival of action, for
example, the "dime thriller", under whose spell so many
boys fall, must be avoided. Literature that leaves the
mind so feverish that the pupil loses interest in other subjects
is worse than no literature. The easiest way to prevent
a taste for this injurious kind, is to give the pupil
an acquaintance with works descriptive of noble deeds
and virile character. An interest in epic poetry or the
historical novel may be developed from the child's instinctive
interest in action. Tennyson's <i>Passing of
Arthur</i>, Arnold's <i>Sohrab and Rustum</i>, Longfellow's <i>Evangeline</i>
and <i>King Robert of Sicily</i>, and Scott's <i>Ivanhoe</i> will
be read with keen enjoyment. The force and beauty of
the language, the faithfulness of the descriptions to life,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
the historical setting, the lofty imagery, and the logical
development will arouse a healthy mental appetite that will
find no pleasure in the worthless story of sensation and
vulgar incident, or even in some badly constructed compositions
of historical adventure.</p>

<p>3. The pupils of the Senior Forms show even more
striking interest in animals, pets, and wild creatures than
do the pupils of the Junior Forms. To this natural interest
is due the engrossing character of nature study.
To it is also due the satisfaction arising from the reading
of some of the many nature stories that have appeared in
recent years.</p>

<p>Thompson-Seton's <i>Wild Animals I have Known</i> and
<i>Lives of the Hunted</i>, and Roberts' <i>The Watchers of the
Trails</i> are excellent examples of this class.</p>

<h3><br />COMPLETE WHOLES VERSUS EXTRACTS</h3>

<p>Scattered throughout the <i>Ontario Readers</i> are to be
found extracts from larger works. These extracts are
placed there primarily because they have some special
literary value. They have fairly complete unity in themselves
and can be treated in detail in a way that would
be impossible with a whole story. The extract has an
advantage over the whole, in that it repays intensive study,
while, in many cases, such study of the whole work would
not be worth while. It is considered better to give the
pupil many of these passages where the author has shown
his greatest art, rather than to allow one long work to absorb
the very limited time which the pupil can devote to this
subject. The study of the extract will have accomplished
its mission if it induces the pupil to read the larger work
for himself in later years. If the treatment by the teacher<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
is made as interesting as it should be, it is hoped that the
pupil will obtain such delight from, and be inspired to
such enthusiasm by, these glimpses of literary treasures,
that he will not be satisfied until he has enjoyed in their
entirety such works as <i>The Lady of the Lake</i>, <i>Pickwick
Papers</i>, <i>Lorna Doone</i>, <i>The Mill on the Floss</i>, <i>Julius C&aelig;sar</i>,
and <i>It is Never Too Late to Mend</i>. An extract may serve
as an introduction to the choicest work of an author, may
arouse an interest in his writings, and give the pupils a
taste of his quality, but, unless it whets their appetites
for the work as a whole, its chief purpose will not have
been accomplished. These extracts cannot give a panoramic
view of a great historical epoch. They do not
require that sustained attention that relates to-day's
readings with that of yesterday, and that takes a wider
survey of many parts in their relation to a central theme.
The larger work gives a culture and a liberal education,
when it is treated in the proper manner, that is very different
from the fragmentary knowledge of an author that
would be gained by even the intensive study of many short
extracts. The treatment of the extract, as we have said,
must be minute; while the whole work should be subsequently
read in a method that will be outlined later on
under the head of Supplementary Reading.</p>

<h3><br />CORRELATION OF LITERATURE
WITH NATURE STUDY, GEOGRAPHY, HISTORY, AND ART</h3>

<p>Many of the lessons in the <i>Ontario Readers</i> should be
preceded by preparatory work in geography, history, or
nature study. Poems such as <i>Jacques Cartier</i>, <i>The Charge
of the Light Brigade</i>, <i>The Burial of Sir John Moore</i>, and
<i>The Armada</i> cannot be fully appreciated unless the historical<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
setting is known. There are famous pictures that
will increase the pupil's interest in these poems. In the
lessons on art, there are studies of pictures that suggest
feelings and thoughts characterized by universality, permanency,
and nobility&mdash;pictures that stir men to nobler
thought and higher aspiration. Often, such pictures are
the painter's method of expressing in colours, thoughts
that the poet has expressed in words. Lessons such as
<i>Dandelions</i>, <i>Bob White</i>, and <i>The Sandpiper</i> require a preliminary
acquaintance with certain facts of nature, and
therefore should be taken, if possible, when these can be
obtained through personal observation by the pupils.
<i>Wolfe and Montcalm</i> and Drake's <i>Voyage Around the
World</i> demand, in addition to historical facts, certain
geographical data. These facts and data should be communicated
at some time before the lessons in literature are
taken, in order that the latter may not descend into lessons
in history, geography, or natural science. The extracts
mentioned above are not placed in the Readers to teach
certain historical, geographical, or scientific facts. They
are placed there, as has been said, primarily because they
have some value as literature. Hence the literature lesson
should require few digressions, the necessary preparatory
work having been done in previous periods.</p>

<p>But while history, geography, nature study, and art
frequently assist in the interpretation of a poem or prose
selection, these subjects, on the other hand, may be reinforced
and strengthened by selections drawn from the
fields of literature. The facts of the history lesson will
be given an additional attractiveness if the pupil is directed
to some well-written biography or drama embodying the
same facts, or if the teacher reads or recites to the class
some spirited ballad, such as <i>Bonnie Dundee</i>, bearing upon<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
the lesson. The interest in the observations made in nature
study will be intensified by reading some nature story
written in good literary form.</p>

<p>While these studies may go hand in hand with literature,
it is not necessary that they should be always taken
on the same day or even in the same week. The literature
lesson may be an effective agent in the recall of ideas
that have had time to be assimilated from previous nature
study, history, or geography lessons. In our enthusiasm
for literature we must not make these subjects the mere
soil and fertilizers out of which the flowers of poetry will
spring. Each of these subjects has its proper sphere, but
that teacher misses many golden opportunities who does
not frequently take a comprehensive survey of his material
in all these studies in order to find the element that will
give a unity to all our knowledge and experience. The
lessons in the Reader may be taken according to the conditions
existing in the class or the inclination of the
teacher. By no means is it necessary to follow the order
in the book.</p>

<h3><br />AIMS IN TEACHING LITERATURE</h3>

<p>The teacher should always have a clear and definite
aim in view in teaching a selection in literature, but
different teachers may have different aims in teaching the
same selection. There should, of course, always be the
general aim to create a taste for good literature by leading
the pupils to appreciate the beauty and power of clear
and artistic expression of thought and feeling; but this
aim must be specific according to the nature of the selection
to be taught. Some specific aims may be given as
suggestive:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span></p>

<p>1. To appeal suitably to such instinctive tastes and
interests of childhood as are already awake and active;
for example, Second Reader, p. 3, <i>My Shadow;</i> p. 185, <i>A
Visit from St. Nicholas;</i> p. 125, <i>Little Gustava;</i> p. 215,
<i>The Children's Hour</i>.</p>

<p>2. To awaken and develop interests and tastes that are
as yet dormant; for example, Second Reader, p. 42, <i>A Song
for Little May;</i> p. 88, <i>The Brown Thrush</i>.</p>

<p>3. To develop and direct the imagination; for example,
Second Reader, p. 72, <i>The New Moon;</i> p. 117, <i>Little
Sorrow;</i> p. 45, <i>The Little Land;</i> p. 172, <i>The Wind</i>.</p>

<p>4. To arouse and quicken the sense of beauty; for
example, Second Reader, p. 92, <i>Mother's World;</i> p. 155,
<i>Lullaby</i>.</p>

<p>5. To exercise and cultivate the emotions; for example,
Second Reader, p. 94, <i>Androclus and the Lion;</i> p. 135,
<i>Ulysses;</i> p. 107, <i>A Night with a Wolf</i>.</p>

<p>6. To develop manners and morals through examples
of character and conduct in action; for example, Second
Reader, p. 114, <i>Joseph II and the Grenadier</i>.</p>

<p>7. To develop appreciation for the well-told story; for
example, Second Reader, p. 5, <i>The Pail of Gold;</i> p. 12,
<i>How I Turned the Grindstone;</i> p. 56, <i>The Blind Men and
the Elephant;</i> p. 211, <i>How the Greeks Took Troy</i>.</p>

<p>8. To develop a true sense of humour; for example,
Second Reader, p. 50, <i>Change About</i>.</p>

<p>9. To develop a sense of reverence; for example,
Second Reader, p. 203, <i>The Lord is my Shepherd;</i> p. 218,
<i>Abide With Me</i>.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span></p>

<h3><br />GENERAL PRINCIPLES APPLICABLE IN
THE TEACHING OF LITERATURE</h3>

<p>There are four outstanding principles of general
method that apply particularly in the teaching of Literature.</p>

<p>I. The pupil must, at the outset, be placed in a receptive
attitude toward the lesson if the best results are
to be secured. He must have some <i>purpose</i> in view if he
is to be induced to concentrate his attention upon it. His
purposes determine his interests, and hence the lesson
must, in some way, be related to interests that already
exist in his mind. Frequently his instinctive interest in
action, in personality, or in excitement is sufficient incentive
to secure his attention. A suspicion that a lesson
contains a good story is often sufficient to ensure a careful
reading of it, and a curiosity as to the writer's devices
to make the story interesting will lead to a closer examination
of it. But more frequently some special interest resulting
from the time of year, the surroundings, or the
work taken in some other subject, may be effectively
utilized by the teacher. These interests of children are
so numerous and so varied that there are few lessons in
the Readers for which a receptive attitude of mind cannot
be secured. It will be observed that the principle here
enunciated corresponds to the "statement of the aim" in
the Herbartian "Formal Steps".</p>

<p>II. The pupil's mind must be suitably prepared for
the assimilation of the ideas contained in the lesson, by
recalling old ideas and feelings that are related to those
to be presented in the selection to be studied. He must
be placed in a proper intellectual attitude to interpret the
ideas and in a proper emotional attitude to appreciate the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
feelings. Neglect of the former may make the selection
wholly meaningless to the pupil; neglect of the latter may
result in entire indifference toward it. A proper intellectual
attitude is necessary in any lesson, but in a lesson
in grammar or arithmetic the emotional attitude may be
almost completely absent. In literature, however, this
emotional attitude is often of the greatest importance,
and the neglect of it may mean an utter lack of appreciation
of some literary masterpiece. This preparatory work
may take the form of a recall of some of the common
experiences of the pupil's life or a review of some facts
taken, for instance, in a previous geography, history, or
nature study lesson. The apperceptive power of the
pupil's mind takes the new material of thought and feeling
contained in the selection and weaves it into the web of
his previous ideas and emotions.</p>

<p>III. The mind always proceeds from a vague and indistinct
idea of a new presentation to a clear and defined
idea of it. The process is always analytic-synthetic. In
a literature lesson the order of procedure must be: (1)
Let the pupil get that somewhat indistinct grasp of the
thought and feeling which comes from a preliminary
reading of it; (2) make this more definite by a process
of analysis, by concentrating attention on the details; (3)
make the idea completely definite by a clear grasp of the
relations existing among the various details, that is, by a
process of synthesis.</p>

<p>IV. No impression is complete without some form of
expression. An idea or emotion is a very incomplete and
useless thing until it is worked out in practice and conduct.
The thoughts and feelings gained from the literature
lesson must be given some kind of expression if they<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
are to be fully realized. This expression may take many
different forms. The pupils may merely read the selection,
showing to the listeners their understanding and
appreciation of it. If it is a story, they may reproduce it
in their own words orally or in writing. They may sketch
a scene or a situation with pencil, or with brush and
colours. They may dramatize it, or act it in pantomime.
They may create a story with a similar theme, or imitate
a poem by a creation of their own. The expression may
not be immediate but may be delayed for days or even
years, and come in some modification of future conduct.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER II</h2>

<h3>METHODS</h3>


<h3>IN JUNIOR FORMS</h3>

<p>To introduce children to the world of literature, it is
not necessary to wait until they have mastered the art of
reading. The introduction should come long before they
have learned to read, through listening to good stories
told or read to them by others, through hearing suitable
poems read or recited with spirit and feeling, and by
memorizing nursery rhymes and gems of poetry.</p>

<p>The material to be used in primary grades has already
been described. Early work in literature should be correlated
with oral composition.</p>

<p>As to the comparative merits of reading and telling,
much may be said on each side. In the early stages,
telling must, of course, be the predominant if not the
exclusive means of communicating the story. The matter
and language can thus be better adjusted to the capacity
of the individual pupil. The teacher who is familiar with
the pupil's home life and surroundings has within his
power a means of adapting the story to the attainments
of the pupil that even the best writer of children's stories
can hardly command. A situation in a story can frequently
be made intelligible by reference to the pupil's
own experience. Moreover, in telling the story, the
teacher's gestures, facial expression, and tone of voice are
likely to be more spontaneous and natural than would be
the case in reading, and this gives immense assistance in
interpreting aright the meaning and spirit of the selection.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span></p>

<p>Some teachers say that the incident, as in the case of
Hawthorne's Tales, is so meagre and the language so
exquisite, that the telling seems to be quite inadequate
and inferior to the reading of the story. In such cases,
variety may be afforded by reading, but generally speaking,
it is more effective to tell the story.</p>

<p>The teacher should strive to become a good story-teller.
This requires a good voice, animated gesture and facial
expression, a good command of English words, power of
graphic description and narration, restraint from digression
and superfluous detail, and concentration of aim
upon some definite point.</p>

<p>In teaching poetry to primary classes, the main object
is to lead the pupils to feel the music and realize the
imagery. To attain this end, the best beginning is made
by a sympathetic and expressive rendering of the passage
by the teacher. It can be recited many times incidentally,
while he is asking the pupils to look at the pretty pictures
suggested by the text. It is not necessary to enter at any
length into an analysis of the poem, unless the pictures
are arranged in an easy order, such as spring, summer,
autumn, winter.</p>

<h3><br />MEMORIZATION</h3>

<p>One of the most valuable means of securing an appreciation
of literature is the memorization of fine passages
of prose and poetry. Pupils from the primary grades
upward should be required to memorize systematically
several lines of prose and poetry every week of the school
year. During childhood the mind is at its most impressionable
stage, and what is committed to memory is then
retained longer and more accurately than what is memorized
at any later period. The passages should be carefully<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
selected and should be suited to the capacity and interests
of the pupils. Nothing should be memorized that has not
<i>some</i> meaning for them, but it would be impossible to
require that every selection should be <i>fully</i> understood.
The selections which children commit to memory in the
most plastic period of their lives will often reveal a new
and unexpected meaning and beauty in later years and
will be a source of keen delight and satisfaction. The
passages memorized will form a standard, unconscious it
may be, by which to test the excellence of other selections.</p>

<p>It is of the greatest importance that the passages
chosen should have artistic excellence in thought, feeling,
music, imagery, and language. Moreover, these qualities
must be present in such a form that they will, when
properly presented by the teacher's reading or reciting,
appeal, in some considerable measure, to the pupils' capacities
and interests. Since there are so many noble passages
in English literature, nothing of doubtful value
should be memorized.</p>

<p>It is also very important that the teacher himself
should have committed to memory and be able to recite
freely and expressively every selection he requires his
pupils to memorize. It is clear that, if he has memorized
it himself, the pupils will be more likely to feel it worth
while to do the same.</p>

<p>In conducting a lesson in memorization, it is well for
the teacher to arouse the interest of the pupils in the
selection as a whole by reciting it himself with expression.
Next, he should see that the pupils understand as clearly
as possible the meaning, and realize and appreciate, as
far as they are able, the feeling of the passage. It should
be treated first as an ordinary literature lesson, after the
manner already described. It should then be read aloud<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
several times by individual pupils, all trying meanwhile
to commit it to memory by concentration of attention on
the ideas and their relations, the words and their meanings.
The principles of all habit formation apply here&mdash;attention
to the thing to be learned, so as to get a clear understanding
of it, and then repetition with attention. When
it has been read several times, individual pupils should be
asked to recite it without any aid. It will be found more
satisfactory to memorize a complete stanza at a time, or
at least a part that expresses a complete thought, rather
than to commit to memory a line at a time. With young
pupils, however, it is well to take small units and let the
children repeat one or two lines at a time till they can
give the whole stanza with ease and accuracy.</p>

<p>It is important that all repetition should be individual,
not simultaneous. Where the latter method is in use, it
is noticeable that pupils adopt a uniform tone and
measured rhythm, both of which are undesirable. Moreover,
especially with young pupils, there is a danger that
absurd blunders made by individuals may pass unnoticed,
because the teacher has not the opportunity of detecting
them. When the passage has been memorized, it should
be repeated daily for a time and then repeated at longer
intervals, until there is little probability of its being forgotten.</p>

<h3><br />IN SENIOR FORMS</h3>

<div class='center'>THE TEACHER'S PREPARATION</div>

<p>The teacher must make himself thoroughly acquainted
with the lesson that he has to teach. When it is an extract,
he should be familiar with the longer work from
which it is taken. He cannot teach the lesson "Maggie
Tulliver" with the highest appreciation if he has not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
read <i>The Mill on the Floss</i>. But there is more than mere
information required for successful teaching. In poetry
the teacher should feel delight in the music, the expression,
the emotion, till he is eager to communicate his
feelings to the pupils. This enthusiasm, however, should
not have in it any insincerity, or extravagant commendation
of the poem or the author. The teacher who has
wide information and genuine interest in his work will
seldom fail to arouse a real pleasure in the literature
lesson.</p>

<p>The relationship between the teacher and the pupils
must be cordial if the lesson is to be successful. This is
true in any subject, but the sympathetic bond must be
especially strong in the literature lesson.</p>

<h3><br />PREPARATION OF PUPILS</h3>

<p>It has already been pointed out that it is frequently
necessary to give preliminary lessons in nature study,
science, history, or geography before the lesson in literature
is presented. The pupil must have the right information
before the literature lesson can arouse the emotion
that the author wishes him to feel.</p>

<p>Not only is the possession of the right information
necessary, but the pupil should be in the right mood for
the lesson. A class that has just returned to the room
after the games at recess is not in the proper state of
mind to appreciate, at once, the recitation by the teacher
of,</p>

<div class='poem'>
Break, break, break,<br />
On thy cold gray stones, O sea!<br />
</div>

<p>Even the enthusiasm and scholarship of the teacher
will fail to be effective under these circumstances. He<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
should arouse in the pupils the proper mental and emotional
state by a very short talk on friendship. He can
refer to the well-known stories of David and Jonathan, or
Damon and Pythias, and tell them of the friendship
existing between Arthur Hallam and Alfred Tennyson.</p>

<p>Before studying <i>Lead, Kindly Light</i> (p. 315, Third
Reader) the teacher might ask the pupils to picture a
solitary traveller in the desert far from home. Night is
approaching; the darkness gathers, and the air grows
chill. What would be the nature of his feelings? Away
in the distance he discovers a faint light glimmering as
from a lantern. Now, how would he feel? Continue till
the pupils can see each part of the picture, the spiritual
significance of which they are to learn through the poem.</p>

<p>To give an extended account of the author's life is a
poor introduction, unless there is something of unusual
interest about his personality or achievements. The pupils
usually do not know anything about him, and the teacher's
aim, in this preparatory work, is to relate the thought
and feeling of the poem to the properly assimilated
knowledge and experience of the pupils. In some cases,
they may have made a favourable acquaintance with the
author in another poem, and this may give the necessary
stimulus to their interest in his life. The best time, however,
to give a biography of an author, when that is helpful,
is after the lesson has been studied, for then the
pupils will appreciate what the teacher has to say about
him personally.</p>

<p>In some poems, the circumstances under which they
are written will be the only introduction necessary, as in
the case of <i>Break, break, break</i> or <i>The Recessional</i>.</p>

<p>There is often an appropriate time for the teaching
of a literature lesson. Sometimes it is the season of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
year. The lesson on <i>An Apple Orchard in the Spring</i>
should come when the blossoms are stimulating every bird
and child with their loveliness, fragrance, and promise.
<i>The First Ploughing</i> and the various poems on birds and
flowers should come at this season. They can be followed,
in turn, by <i>A Midsummer Song</i> and <i>The Maple</i>. There
are poems in the Readers for September, November,
Indian Summer, and Winter; and a wealth of material
for the Christmas season. Yet the season may not always
determine the time for such lessons. The pupil who has
observed again and again an apple orchard in the spring,
and who knows birds and trees, has a store of memories
that will enable him to picture vividly what he reads about
these at any time.</p>

<p>It may be objected that these methods of introduction
make the pupil depend too much on the teacher, and do
not throw him sufficiently on his own resources. It is
to be remembered, however, that the great object of
teaching literature is to cultivate a taste for it. When
the pupil approaches a selection with ideas and feelings
which are already, in his consciousness, related to those
presented in the poem, he is in the best possible mental
attitude to appreciate it, and the probability of his liking
it is much greater than if it were presented without any
such introduction. The pupil's first impressions of a
poem are all-important, and it is essential that his first
introduction to it should be made under the most favourable
circumstances. If his first acquaintance with poetry
is made under pleasant conditions, he will inevitably
develop a taste for poetical literature, and that is the
object which the teacher has in view. When this taste
has been formed, it will not be necessary that the teacher
should be at hand in order to recall the proper experiences<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
for the interpretation of a passage. The pupil will read
appreciatively on his own account, without any such
assistance.</p>

<p>In all cases, the preparation of the pupils for the
lesson must be short. Nothing more should be given
than will suffice to bring them into a suitable mood;
usually some simple experience of their lives is ample.
The time for the lesson is always limited, and the proportion
between the introduction and the main theme must
always be maintained.</p>

<h3><br />PRESENTATION</h3>

<p>The next step in the development of the lesson is the
presentation. How shall this be done? There are three ways:
The teacher may ask the pupils to read the lesson silently
at their seats or at home and come prepared to participate
in the discussion; or he may ask some of them to read the
lesson aloud; or he, himself, may read it to the pupils.
The merits of each of these methods will be considered.</p>

<p>In prose, it is advisable to let the pupils read the selection
before the lesson is taken up by the teacher. The
pupils must have practice in getting the thought from
the symbols on the printed page and in grasping the
general trend of the story, the description, or the argument.
The work will be mainly intellectual, but the pupils
may also, at this stage, have practice in discovering the
emotional elements in some of the prose extracts.</p>

<p>In the higher Forms, the teacher may occasionally
allow some of his best readers to read a poem aloud, where
the emotion is evident or the narrative plain. <i>The Barefoot
Boy</i>, p. 118, Fourth Reader; <i>The Homes of England</i>,
p. 375; and <i>Bernardo del Carpio</i>, p. 131, are examples of
this kind.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span></p>

<p>It is usually a better plan for the teacher to read the
poem to the pupils. With many poems of exquisite music
and imagery, such as <i>The Bugle Song</i>, p. 337, Third
Reader, the reading by a pupil who has not yet caught
the meaning and spirit will be a failure, and the teacher
will see that the mood that he has prepared with care at
the opening is so certain to be dissipated that he must
intervene in order to prevent the spoiling of the lesson.
But the teacher who has studied the poem and whose
feelings have been deeply stirred by its music and pictures
can, through his reading, communicate to his pupils his
own appreciation; and it will be a dull pupil who does
not feel the contagion. It is, however, not well to insist
on too great uniformity in method; the spirit rather than
the form is vital.</p>

<h3><br />VALUE OF ORAL READING IN
THE INTERPRETATION AND APPRECIATION OF LITERATURE</h3>

<p>1. To the reader himself. Poetical literature is akin to
music. Poetry was originally sung by the minstrel, and
the thought and feeling were communicated to the
audience solely by the ear. The study of poetry by the
eye is artificial, modern, and contrary to our hereditary
instincts. We should not argue that the best way to
appreciate music is found in following the symbols on
the music sheet. It is only the highly educated musician
who can imagine the delights of music by an examination
of the written text. To some degree, it is the same with
poetry. The music of the words and the appropriateness
of the rhythm cannot be fully perceived by merely silent
reading. The eye alone would never detect the exquisite
music of such a poem as <i>Hide and Seek</i>, Third Reader,
p. 50, or <i>Break, break, break</i>, p. 201. Nor could it perceive<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
the suitability of the rhythm to the theme, as exhibited
in <i>How They Brought the Good News from Ghent
to Aix</i>, Fourth Reader, p. 351. In this poem, we can
hear in the rhythm the hoof beats of the horses as they
gallop along. How often have we felt a new meaning and
appropriateness that our voice alone has suggested!</p>

<p>2. To the listeners. The contagious nature of emotion
has already been pointed out. The good reader, by
his sympathetic and expressive rendering of the poem,
may reveal to his listeners depths of feeling, the existence
of which they had not before suspected. We have often
been thrilled by a new emotion, upon hearing a familiar
passage read by another.</p>

<p>Every teacher should be a good reader. His tone of
voice, his movement, his gestures are the signs by which
the pupils interpret his emotional attitude. If he is not
already a good reader, he should bend all his energies to
become one. Persevering practice, attention to mechanical
features, such as distinct articulation, pausing, flexibility
of voice, and, above all, a sympathetic appreciation of the
author's thought and feeling, will soon convert a poor
reader into a good one. He will soon find that his voice
will accommodate itself insensibly in pitch, tone, and
movement to the changing emotions of the poem. The
delight of the lesson will be greatly enhanced where the
reader lends to the rhyme of the poet the music of his
voice.</p>

<p>The reading reveals the general thought of the poem.
In simpler poems, the pupils will recognize in the reading
the relationship and the intent of many of the subordinate
parts. But the intellectual side is only secondary. Literature,
in its finer forms, is not primarily an intellectual
subject, such as grammar or mathematics. The emotional<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
tone, the spiritual meaning, and the artistic form&mdash;these
are the main elements, and these can be best developed
by good reading. The teacher should acquire
the habit of reading poetry aloud in his home, and should
induce his pupils to follow his example. Further, as two
senses will give a more vivid realization of thought than
one, the pupil, in the class, should follow with his eye
the reading of the teacher; and it is helpful for a church
congregation to follow with the eye the reading of the
scripture lesson by the minister.</p>

<h3><br />THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE MAIN THOUGHT</h3>

<p>The teacher should next assist the pupils to discover
the main thought of the lesson. In many cases the
meaning will be very vague, and the pupils will have
difficulty in formulating a terse and comprehensive statement
of the subject of the poem. If the question is asked
in a stereotyped form, such as "What is the main thought
of the poem?" the enthusiasm of the pupils is often chilled.
The teacher may, if it is a narrative poem, ask for the
main points in the story, and may assist the pupils by
calling attention to some pertinent passage, or by removing
difficulties by means of questions or explanations. In
all cases, it is well to accept a partially correct answer by
the pupils, and to try to improve its imperfection by
questioning, until a fairly complete and substantial statement
has been given. Every answer which contains even
a fragment of sound thought should receive due recognition.
In some cases it is sufficient, at the outset, to take
an imperfect statement of the main thought, since the
study of the poem will reveal its defects. The teacher
must keep before his pupils this statement, so that at the
conclusion of the lesson they will be quite ready to replace<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
it by a more accurate one. The teacher should be careful
that the emotions aroused by the poem are not unduly
weakened or dissipated by the analysis of its intellectual
content. Many lessons by young teachers fail just at this
point, by reason of questioning unskilfully or by rejecting
answers that do not correspond to their own cut-and-dried
preconceptions.</p>

<p>The teacher should follow a similar method in discovering
the leading thought of the subdivisions of the
poem. These often correspond to the stanza forms, but
the lesson may become very wearisome by insisting on too
great detail. The poem often falls into two or three main
divisions, into which the various stanzas may be grouped.
With Senior Forms it is a good exercise to ask the pupils
to make this grouping, but, with those not so advanced,
the teacher himself may make it and ask the pupils for
the central thought in each group. In the teacher's
anxiety to have these subjects clearly stated, he runs the
risk of wasting time and, worse than that, of killing whatever
interest the pupils may have had up to this point.
If the pupils could give these subjects with perfect clearness
now, there would be little else to do. The greatest
care must be exercised to prevent the work becoming
mechanical, thus destroying the interest and making the
selection distasteful.</p>

<p>With some pupils, the logical sense is quite strong,
and they find their greatest delight in seeing the purpose
of each part in a complex mechanism. With others, this
work does not afford much pleasure. These are children
who, later, can take delight in the flimsy plot of a musical
comedy. Such pupils should be encouraged to do their<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
best to discover some points of beauty or skill in the
arrangement of the selection. In different lessons there
is a difference in construction. In some, the logical connection
and development is so important that this quality
must be stressed, but the works of some authors have
merits which throw the arrangement into a very subordinate
position; for example, "Ring out, Wild Bells",
from <i>In Memoriam</i>.</p>

<h3><br />MINUTE ANALYSIS</h3>

<p>The next stage in the analysis is the examination of
the passage minutely. There is always a place in the
lesson for the study of words and phrases. The teacher
should ask questions on these, in order to ascertain if the
pupils have felt their force and vitality. They are to be
taken up only to illuminate and impress the main thoughts
and emotions of the poem.</p>

<p>In some cases, as in prose lessons, the pupils may
acquire the dictionary habit. This develops and cultivates
a studious disposition and accuracy of statement.
But in poetry there are many subtle meanings that the
dictionary will not give, but which the pupil has learned
through contact with educated people and acquaintance
with books. Most of the words that people use have not
been learned from the dictionary, but from their context
in reading or conversation.</p>

<p>On the other hand, many lessons are spoiled by too
constant inquiry into meanings. There is much mere
learning of meanings without reference to the thought
or emotion that they are intended to explain. Many
words are explained that are already understood. The
fault may be due to the teacher's experience with annotated
text-books of literature. The teacher, who has been prepared<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
for his examination by this method, is disposed to
carry it into Elementary School work, till even <i>The
Recessional</i> becomes merely a theme for learning verbal
meanings.</p>

<h3><br />ALLUSIONS</h3>

<p>There are many references in the text-books to geographical,
scientific, and historical matters. If these
allusions. In poems such as <i>The Armada</i> there must be
a preliminary lesson such as has been indicated. Very
often the enthusiast in these subjects will make literature
a mere peg on which to hang much information. Teachers
often make long digressions in connection with these
allusions, till the mood of the poem is completely lost in
the mist of the disquisitions. The same method should
be adopted in teaching allusions as in teaching the
meanings of words. Only such explanation is necessary
as will show the purpose of the author in introducing the
allusions. In poems such as <i>The Armada</i> there must be
considerable explanation given, before the pupils will feel
the emotion that the author hopes to kindle by the mention
of the names that are used in it. With Canadian
children, the effect in the case of this poem cannot be so
great as with English children, who are more familiar
with the special geographical and historical associations.</p>

<p>The teacher of young people cannot hope, by explanation
of the allusions, to arouse all the pleasure and the
vitality of emotion that will be induced in the reader who
has the culture that comes of wide reading; nor can the
teacher communicate this emotion when the information
is new. The pleasure comes, later on, from the recall of
information that was assimilated in earlier years.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span></p>

<h3><br />THE IMAGERY</h3>

<p>The language of poetry is generally concrete. The
artist may wish to give expression to a general truth, or
philosophical principle, or ethereal fancy. These appear
very abstract, but the artist embodies in material forms
the idea he wishes to convey. The poet expresses his
thought by the suggestion of material imagery, and emotion
is most readily aroused by these images.</p>

<p>Antony, in his funeral oration after C&aelig;sar's death,
knew how to arouse his audience to fury by showing them
C&aelig;sar's wounds and holding before them C&aelig;sar's mantle
with its rents. Not always can the real object be produced
for these emotional effects, but the teacher can
sometimes bring into the class-room, for the benefit of
young pupils, concrete material such as pictures and
work in manual training. He can also call attention, at
times, to the falling snow or the colour of the leaves or
the sky, by asking the pupils to look out of the class-room
windows. But in most cases, he has to be content with
trying to recall the memory of these natural things. This
shows how valuable has been the excursion of the boy
into the country, and his experience on holidays by the
river and in the harvest field. The nature study lesson
furnishes the material for future enjoyment of poetry.</p>

<p>The pupils in our schools are very capable in realizing
visual imagery. They can see the visual image very
readily with its colour, form, and movement. They can
arrange the objects in the picture with foreground, background,
light, and shade.</p>

<p>But it is quite a different matter when they try to
realize auditory imagery. In the poem <i>Waterloo</i>, Fourth
Reader, p. 311, they can see the picture in "bright the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
lamps shone o'er fair women and brave men". They see
the large ball-room with its glass chandeliers, the costumes
of handsome ladies, the scarlet uniforms and the
decorations of the officers and the nobility. But can they
realize the next imagery, that of sound, "and when music
arose with its voluptuous swell"? Do they hear the
squeaking of one or two fiddles or do they hear the
voluminous sound of regimental bands? Do they notice
the varying metre from the stately iambic to the sudden
"voluptuous swell" of the foot of three syllables in waltz
time?</p>

<p>These images of sight and sound picture the gaiety
and magnificence of this festive scene, in order to make
more marked the contrast with the fear and pathos of
the farewells. This contrast is enforced by the two
auditory images:</p>

<div class='poem'>
And all went merry as a marriage bell;<br />
But hush! hark! a deep sound strikes like a rising knell!<br />
</div>

<p>Can your pupils image the wedding-bells chiming from
the cathedral some afternoon in June, when suddenly the
ear catches the sound of a death-bell tolling from another
church? Any reader who cannot realize the sounds of
those two bells with their discordant effects will miss the
intention of Byron.</p>

<p>The pupils, through the stimulation of their senses,
must have experienced the luxurious effects of orchards,
flower gardens, and clover fields; the odours of apple
blossoms and the smell and taste of the "full-juiced apple
waxing over-mellow"; the perfumes and temperatures of
spring, midsummer, and winter if they are to read nature
literature intelligently and feel its charm. The words must
have meaning if they are to awaken the feeling that was
part of the original experience.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span></p>

<h3><br />THE LITERATURE OF NOBLE THOUGHT</h3>

<p>In literature, as in other arts, there is a great deal
that is merely decorative. It is not the purpose here to
disparage this form of art. "A thing of beauty is a joy
for ever. Its loveliness increases." Some of the most
famous portraits and landscapes in the picture galleries
afford infinite pleasure to the student of art by the
technique in colour, drawing, and arrangement. They
are greater than photography. "The light that never
was on sea or land, the consecration and the poet's dream"
have given them a beauty that is greater than the realism
of the actual person or natural scene. It is the same in
literature. The author's feelings, his language, the
rhythm of his words, and his delicate fancy afford the
reader greater delight than he has ever known when he has
met similar persons, scenes, or actions in real life. This
is genuine &aelig;sthetic pleasure, similar to the pleasure that
people derive from china, music, or landscape gardening.</p>

<p>There is, however, a higher form of art in both pictures
and literature. There are pictures that suggest
some noble aspiration, some great universal truth, some
great conflict between duty and interest. We feel instinctively
that these are greater than pictures possessing
mere masterly technique. It is the same in literature.
There are poems in which we feel that the thoughts and
feelings are sublime. Perhaps the technique of these is
not equal to that of the poetry described in the preceding
paragraph, but the experienced teacher has felt his pupils
lifted above mundane affairs, when they begin to grasp
the true significance of such poems. The youngest pupils
show their appreciation by wide open eyes, when these
are read. They instinctively feel that this work is better
than the merely pretty and dainty things in poetry.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span></p>

<p>In the <i>Ontario Readers</i> we have numerous poems of
this nature. In the First Reader, the pupils instinctively
feel that <i>Piping Down the Valleys Wild</i> is of different
calibre from <i>Three Little Kittens</i>. <i>The Lord is my
Shepherd</i>, <i>Lead, Kindly Light</i>, and <i>To a Waterfowl</i>, are
examples of this class.</p>

<p>In teaching these lessons, the spiritual meaning should
be constantly emphasized.</p>

<p>The mere statement of the thought is not impressive.
It is the presentation of it in poetical form that makes
its effect impressive and lasting. The pupils may be led
to discover how the author has accomplished this by
means of the concrete embodiment of imagery, language,
metaphor, and music.</p>

<h3><br />RECAPITULATION</h3>

<p>The lesson is often dropped just at this time, leaving
an impression somewhat like that of a science room, with
the petals and leaves on the desks and the floor, after
the class in botany has been dismissed. No act of analysis
is complete without a final synthesis. The examination of
the various phases of the whole must be followed by a
reconstruction in which are perceived the relations of the
various phases to each other and to the unity of the
whole. These various parts must be closely related to
one another if the final conception of the poem is to be
definite. When the analysis is in progress, the teacher
should not, of course, take each part by itself and examine
it as if it were an isolated thing, but its relation to what
has gone before should be more or less clearly perceived.
When the analysis is complete, there should be a final
synthesis in which the relations of the various parts stand
out definitely. This can be done by means of a statement<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
of the main thought in concise but comprehensive terms.
If the teacher has accepted an imperfect statement at
the beginning, the pupils will now be in a position to
discover its inadequacy and supply the part that is lacking.
Then the subjects of the various subdivisions or stanzas
can be restated in suitable terms that will show the proper
relationships. This reconstruction may also take the form
of oral or written reproduction of the selection. This
is especially valuable after the prose lessons. There should
follow an oral reading of the passage by the pupils, which
will serve to show the teacher how much of the feeling
of the poem has been absorbed, how clearly the pupils
have understood the meaning, and what misconceptions
have arisen in their minds.</p>

<h3><br />MISTAKES IN TEACHING LITERATURE</h3>

<p>There are some mistakes in teaching literature that
are noted here, in order that they may be avoided:</p>

<p>1. Teaching pupils about literature, instead of
teaching literature itself; for example, teaching biography,
etymology, history, geography, or science in the literature
lesson, because some feature of one or more of these
may be suggested by the language of the lesson. A
knowledge of such subjects is merely preparatory to the
study of literature itself.</p>

<p>2. Teaching merely the meanings of words and phrases,
and omitting the greater things of imagery, thought,
beauty of language, and the spirit of the writer.</p>

<p>3. Trying to force appreciation by telling the pupils
they must learn to like such and such works because
educated people like them. It is useless, at this time,
to try to develop the critical spirit, as the pupil has not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
a sufficiently wide acquaintance with literary works on
which to form a judgment.</p>

<p>4. Doing for the pupil what he should be led to do
for himself. A literature lesson, in which the teacher
has been doing all the talking, or both asking and answering
questions, will be barren of good results.</p>

<p>5. Paraphrasing. Short passages may be paraphrased,
in order to show whether the pupil has understood the
force and vitality of the metaphor or the condensed expression.
But paraphrasing must be used with great
discretion. The teacher will not make the pupils appreciate
the beauty of a fine literary selection by converting
refined gold into low grade ore.</p>

<p>6. Attempting to draw some moral from every lesson.
Not all lessons are didactic. If the pupils have sympathized
with what is noble and just in the story, the
statement of a moral at the conclusion is unnecessary.
Yet in poems that are plainly didactic, for example, <i>To
a Waterfowl</i>, Fourth Reader, p. 377, the moral lesson
must occupy the first place. There the teacher should
show how the author has enforced the lesson of <i>confidence
in God's guidance</i> by the incident of the migrating
waterfowl, the imagery, the music, the arrangement of
parts, and the similarity of his own position to that of
the bird.</p>

<p>7. Dwelling unnecessarily on the intellectual side of
a poem that is mainly emotional and musical; for example,
<i>The Bugle Song</i>, Third Reader, p. 337, and <i>The Solitary
Reaper</i>, Fourth Reader, p. 261. In the former case, the
pupils should be led to realize the visual imagery, should
hear, in imagination, the bugle calls and fading echoes,
and enjoy the rare and appropriate music. In the second
case, the teacher should call attention to the artistic suggestions<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
of loneliness, distance, antiquity, sadness, and
vagueness that are suggested by "old, unhappy, far-off
things, and battles long ago", and by such possible situations
of English travellers in remote parts of the world,
and should show that these elements are suitable for the
circumstances under which the poet sees the girl. He
who questions merely to find out the meaning of the poem,
the relation to that of its subordinate parts, and the
meaning of the words and phrases, is using a very heavy
tool on a very delicate mechanism. Such works must be
treated deftly and lightly.</p>

<h3><br />EXTENSIVE READING</h3>

<p>The class of literature that we have described in the
preceding methods is condensed literature, where thought
is large in proportion to the number of the words. It must
be read by a process of close thinking, in an analytic,
exhaustive manner. There must be a clear comprehension
of the central ideas, and a strong grasp of minor
thoughts or details, and the relation of these to the central
ideas. While this power to grasp thought intensively is
very valuable, we should also have the power to grasp
the thought rapidly and comprehensively.</p>

<p>In some works, the thought is not so condensed and
confined. Here, the main effort of the reader is to grasp
the thoughts successively in a rapid, clear, and comprehensive
manner. He must be able to read a book chapter
by chapter and grasp the central ideas, to hold paragraph
after paragraph, chapter after chapter, in his consciousness,
so that each gives added illumination to the main
thought and, at the end, the whole of the work stands
out in its entirety. He must learn to grasp the central
thought in each section as he proceeds&mdash;to sift the wheat<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
from the chaff. The minor details have been of value in
giving him the main thought, but the real ability of the
good reader consists in dropping these minor details from
the mind and holding steadily on to the more important
facts.</p>

<p>This method gives a greater power of sustained attention
and a wider acquaintance with good literature. Most
of our reading is done in this way. It would be impossible
otherwise to get a wide range, as time does not
permit of minute analysis, and many of our longer works
are so diffuse that they would not repay such careful
study.</p>

<p>The supplementary, or extensive, reading may be
given as seat work or home work. As seat work, it can
come as a grateful relief from the arduous tasks in the
ungraded school and will keep many an active mind from
getting into mischief. By questioning about the main
facts the teacher can assure himself that the work has
actually been done. This questioning should not be used
only to catch the negligent; it should give pleasure to
the pupils as a conversation with them about their
pleasant occupation. It should be done very informally,
often as two intelligent people would discuss a book. The
questions should be broad in their scope and should not
dwell on matters of detail. If it is a story that is to be
considered, it should be examined as follows: Discover
what are the difficulties set up; how they are brought
about; how they are overcome; how many threads of
interest there are; why certain characters are introduced;
what would be the effect if certain parts were omitted;
to what extent the final solution is logical.</p>

<p>When the examination is finished, a series of compositions
might be written on topics connected with the story.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
For instance, if <i>Rip Van Winkle</i> has been studied, a series
of three compositions might be assigned: (1) Rip's
domestic life; (2) his adventure in the mountain; (3) his
return to the village. Three compositions would be better
than a single one on the whole story, because too great condensation
usually detracts from the value, and because the
excellence of a school composition is usually in inverse
proportion to its length.</p>

<p>It is exceedingly important that the teacher should
see that these written exercises are not made distasteful
to the pupil. They are very valuable if they are not considered
irksome. The object is not so much to give skill
in composition as to create a taste for wide and excellent
reading. It would be better to allow this written reproduction
to drop rather than to associate the pleasures of
literature with something disagreeable.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER III</h2>

<h3>ILLUSTRATIVE LESSONS</h3>


<p>In the lessons that follow, the answers given to questions
are those which pupils may be expected to give after corrections
and additions have been made by themselves and
the teacher.</p>

<p>Professor Alexander has said:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>It is impossible to exemplify on paper actual teaching.
Actual teaching, as all other practical matters, is in
large measure determined by circumstances and conditions
which are never twice the same. A large part of
a teacher's skill lies in the sympathetic perception of
these conditions and in the power of adapting himself
to them on the spur of the moment. The teacher should
have a definite aim in view, and a general conception
of the proper method to be followed; but these will be
modified by the character of the pupils before him, of
the answers given, of the manifestation of interest, and
the comprehension of the various points brought forward.
A question quite proper in one case will be quite
out of place in another. What knowledge should be
imparted by the instructor, what elicited from the pupils
themselves, what matters dwelt upon, what lightly passed
over&mdash;these things can only be determined by the actual
circumstances.</p></div>


<h3><br />PANTOMIME</h3>

<h4>LITTLE MISS MUFFET</h4>

<div class='center'>(Primer, page 75)</div>

<p>Little Miss Muffet sits on a low chair eating from
an imaginary dish. The spider comes creeping softly
behind her. When he reaches her side, he sits quietly
down. Then she sees him and, in a great fright, jumps
up and runs away.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span></p>

<h3><br />DRAMATIZATION</h3>

<h4>LITTLE BOY BLUE</h4>

<div class='center'>(Primer, page 68)</div>

<p>The senior division of the primary class had read the
story of Little Boy Blue. Norman asked: "May we play
it? May I be Little Boy Blue?"</p>

<p>Allan said: "I'd like to be the farmer".</p>

<p>Dorothy wished to be the farmer's wife.</p>

<p>Clara asked if the pupils of the highest class might
be the cows and the sheep.</p>

<p>As Norman was enthusiastic and eager to express
himself, he was permitted to direct the movements of the
different characters.</p>

<p>The farmer selected a horse and prepared to take him
to market, while Little Boy Blue could be seen tramping
along the road (the front part of the room). The cows
and sheep were grazing quietly near by.</p>

<p>As Little Boy Blue approached the farmer, he removed
his cap and said: "Good morning, sir, do you want a
boy?"</p>

<p><i>Farmer:</i> "Yes, I want one to watch the cows and
the sheep."</p>

<p><i>Little Boy Blue:</i> "I can do that, sir."</p>

<p><i>Farmer</i> (handing Little Boy Blue a toy horn that
had been brought to school for use during a drawing
lesson): "Here is a horn, then. If they try to go away,
blow this, and they will come back."</p>

<p><i>Little Boy Blue:</i> "I will, sir."</p>

<p>The farmer drove away, and Little Boy Blue watched
the cows and the sheep. Once they were about to wander
away (among the aisles), but Little Boy Blue blew the
horn, and they immediately returned. He soon grew tired<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
of watching them; they seemed to be content to graze
quietly where they were. He leaned against a haystack
(a chair) and fell asleep. The cows were soon in the
corn and the sheep in the meadow, where the farmer saw
them as he was driving home. But he could not see
Little Boy Blue. He called:</p>

<div class='poem'>
Little Boy Blue,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Come blow your horn,</span><br />
The sheep are in the meadow,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The cows are in the corn.</span><br />
</div>

<p><i>Farmer:</i> "Wife, where is Little Boy Blue?"</p>

<p><i>Wife:</i> "He is under the haystack, fast asleep."</p>

<p><i>Farmer</i> (going to haystack):</p>

<div class='poem'>
Little Boy Blue,<br />
Come blow your horn.<br />
</div>

<p>The boy jumped up, blew a blast on the horn, and the
sheep and cows immediately came back.</p>

<p><i>Little Boy Blue:</i> "It was my fault and I'm sorry."</p>

<p><i>Farmer:</i> "All right, you'll take better care of them
next time."</p>


<h4><br />THE STORY OF HENNY PENNY</h4>

<div class='center'>(Primer, page 48)</div>

<p>When the teacher suggests that a game be played,
many pupils fairly project themselves backward in an
effort to look so well that they may be chosen to take part
in it.</p>

<p>The teacher wrote "Dorothy" on the black-board.
Dorothy whispered that she would like to play the story
of Henny Penny. (The adventures of Henny Penny
had been recounted the day before.) The teacher wrote<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
the story of Henny Penny. As Dorothy had sufficient
self-confidence and a good memory, she was allowed to
choose her part, which was certain to be that of the principal
character. Had she not possessed these qualities,
she would have been assigned a minor part during the
first attempt at dramatizing this story. The teacher
wrote "Rooster Pooster" on the black-board. "I should
like to be Rooster Pooster", said Albert. "Turkey
Lurkey", wrote the teacher. "I'd like to be Turkey
Lurkey", said another. In this or some similar way, the
parts were assigned.</p>

<p>As the play began, Henny Penny was discovered
pecking at imaginary worms in the garden; suddenly she
jumped up in a great fright. "Oh, the sky is falling!"
she said, "I must run and tell the king". She ran down
the road (an aisle) till she met Rooster Pooster.</p>

<p>When he saw her coming, he stopped crowing and
asked, "Where are you going, Henny Penny?" "Oh",
she said, "the sky is falling, and I am going to tell the
king". "I will go too", said Rooster Pooster. They
ran down the road till they met Turkey Lurkey gobbling
contentedly. The usual formula was repeated, and
Turkey Lurkey ran on with them.</p>

<p>But the fox (villain) was waiting around the corner.
"Where are you going, Henny Penny, Rooster Pooster,
and Turkey Lurkey?" said he. "Oh, Fox Lox", they
said, "the sky is falling and we are going to tell the king".
"I will show you the way." "Oh, no, Fox Lox, we know
you. We will not go with you."</p>

<p>So they ran and ran, but had to return home because
they did not find the king's house.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span></p>


<h4><br />WISHES</h4>

<div class='center'>(Primer, page 52)</div>

<p>The pupils knew by the pictures on page 52 that the
lesson would be a delightful one, but when they attempted
to read it, they found difficulties that lessened their
pleasure somewhat.</p>

<p>They enjoyed reading "I wish I could find a little
fat fly", but "sad little sigh" and "an odd little shrug"
were very difficult to say and were meaningless until the
children imitated the teacher's "sad little sighs" and
"odd little shrugs".</p>

<p>The pupils were then asked which little chicken they
would like to be. The first pupil to respond was chosen.
He went to the front of the room, which was then a
garden, and with a much bigger sigh than was necessary,
complained: "I wish I could find a little fat fly".</p>

<p>The other pupils then eagerly studied the page, that
they might learn what the next little chicken said and
did. The teacher was always ready to tell them any
words they could not discover for themselves. One pupil
could make a shrug but could not remember the second
little chicken's words, so another was found who could
say what the second little chicken said in just the way he
would say it if he could talk. The other little chickens
and the mother hen were chosen in a similar manner.</p>

<p>The mother hen could be seen busily scratching at one
end of the garden, while her little chickens were walking
aimlessly about.</p>

<p><i>First Chicken</i> (after sighing):</p>

<p>"I wish I could find a little fat fly."</p>

<p><i>Second Chicken</i> (with a shrug):</p>

<p>"I wish I could find a fat little bug."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Third Chicken</i> (with a squeaky voice):</p>

<p>"I wish I could feel some corn in my beak."</p>

<p><i>Fourth Chicken</i> (sighing):</p>

<p>"I wish I could find a fat worm on a leaf."</p>

<p><i>Mother Hen</i> (impatiently):</p>

<p>"See here, if you want things to eat, just come here
and scratch."</p>


<h4><br />INDIAN LULLABY</h4>

<div class='poem'>
Rock-a-bye, my little owlet,<br />
In the mossy, swaying nest,<br />
With thy little woodland brothers,<br />
Close thine eyes and take thy rest.<br />
<br />
Hush-a-bye, my little owlet,<br />
Many voices sing to thee;<br />
"Hush-a-bye," the water whispers,<br />
"Hush!" replies the tall pine tree.<br />
</div>

<div class='sig'>
&mdash;<span class="smcap">Longfellow</span><br />
</div>

<p>There had been language lessons on the habits of the
Indians; their way of living had been worked out, as
far as possible, on the sand-table, and pictures representing
Indian life had been shown. The pupils had
eagerly constructed an Indian home&mdash;"Dark behind it
rose the forest" (twigs from the pine and other evergreen
trees), "Bright before it beat the water".</p>

<p>The lessons in drawing, painting, end modelling had
been connected with this work. From their boxes of
coloured crayons, the pupils had selected the colours used
in making the pine trees, the grass, the bark of the trees,
the owl in the tree, the wigwams, etc.</p>

<p>From the many beautiful Indian lullabies that would
have been suitable, the teacher selected the <i>Indian Lullaby</i>
by Longfellow. During the periods set apart for music,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
the pupils had been taught the desired melody with the
syllable "loo".</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>Teacher.</i> "How does your mother put baby to sleep?"</p>

<p><i>Pupils.</i> "My mother rocks the baby in her arms." "Mine
puts him on the bed and he falls asleep." "We rock our baby
in a cradle," etc.</p>

<p><i>Teacher.</i> "The picture I give you will show you what
the Indian mother does with her baby."</p></div>

<p>Each pupil was given a small picture showing an
Indian baby in his cradle suspended from a tree. These
pictures had been cut from a supplement to <i>Primary
Education</i>.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>Teacher.</i> "What has the mother done?"</p>

<p><i>Pupils.</i> "She has put her baby in a basket and hung it
on a tree."</p>

<p><i>Teacher.</i> "Is the baby in the picture awake or asleep?"</p>

<p><i>Pupils.</i> "He is asleep."</p>

<p><i>Teacher.</i> "What could the baby see before he went to
sleep?"</p></div>

<p>Here a picture&mdash;fourteen by twenty inches&mdash;was
shown. It was a good representation of an Indian home
and its surroundings. The pupils had made use of this
picture when working at the sand-table.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>Pupils.</i> "He could see the pine trees, the water, the
wigwams, the canoes, the Indians," etc.</p>

<p><i>Teacher.</i> "What could the baby hear while swinging in
his cradle?"</p>

<p><i>Pupils.</i> "He could hear the Indians talking. He could
hear the wind among the trees; the water; the birds singing
in the woods; the cry of an owl; perhaps wolves, bears," etc.</p>

<p><i>Teacher.</i> "What other babies lived in the woods?"</p>

<p><i>Pupils.</i> "Birds, squirrels, owls, wolves," etc.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Teacher.</i> "A man once wrote what he thought an Indian
mother might have sung to her baby. This is what he
thought she would sing." (The teacher recited the <i>Indian
Lullaby</i>.)</p></div>

<p>Individual pupils then repeated one stanza at a time
with the assistance of the teacher.</p>

<p>The pupils sang softly the melody they had learned
to "loo"; then all tried to sing the words with the
teacher. The purpose was to emphasize the rhythm and
interpret the spirit of the poem. The lesson occupied
twelve to fifteen minutes. At another time, hectographed
copies of the poem were given to the pupils, and as they
had already partly memorized it, they soon learned to
read it.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV</h2>

<h3>FORM I: SENIOR GRADE</h3>


<h4>THE WIND AND THE LEAVES</h4>

<div class='center'>(First Reader, page 49)</div>

<p>It is the aim of this lesson to help the pupils to appreciate
imaginative descriptions of some natural phenomena.
This lesson will be best appreciated if taken some day
in autumn when the leaves are falling. If the pupils
have recently noticed the wind rushing through the trees,
scattering the many-coloured leaves and driving them
before it along the ground, they will be in the best mood
to enter into the spirit of the poem.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>What is the time of the year that the poem speaks about?
The autumn.</p>

<p>Select all the things that tell you this. The leaves have
"dresses of red and gold"; "summer is gone"; "the days
grow cold"; the leaves come "fluttering" down; the "fields"
are "brown".</p>

<p>What did the wind mean by "Come o'er the meadows
with me, and play"? It meant that they should come down
from the trees and be blown away by the wind across the
fields.</p>

<p>What does it mean by "Put on your dresses of red and
gold"? Before they fall, the leaves have many beautiful
colours.</p>

<p>What was the colour of their dresses in summer? When
do they begin to change colour very quickly?</p>

<p>What leaves show the most beautiful colours? What
different colours have you noticed that leaves have?</p>

<p>When does the wind call? When it blows loudly or
whistles.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span></p>

<p>Do you know what the wind says when it calls? Why
not? We do not understand the language that it speaks.</p>

<p>How did the leaves show that they understood? They
obeyed at once and came down from the trees.</p>

<p>What is meant by "fluttering" down? They came down
slowly, moving from side to side, and turning over and over
as they fell. (This could be shown in the class-room quite
easily.)</p>

<p>Which line in the first stanza corresponds in meaning
with the third line of the second? The second line.</p>

<p>What makes the fields "brown"? It is the end of the
summer, and the grass and the plants have dried up.</p>

<p>What colours have the fields at other seasons of the year?
Green in the spring, golden in the summer, white in the
winter.</p>

<p>What are "the soft little songs" of the leaves? The
rustling sounds they make as they are blown about by the
wind.</p>

<p>Why do we not understand their songs? For the same
reason that we do not understand the call of the wind&mdash;their
language is not ours.</p>

<p>"Winter had called them." What is the voice of winter?
The cold winds that roar and whistle.</p>

<p>What is meant by "content"? The leaves were quite
glad to answer the call.</p>

<p>Why were they content? The work that they had been
doing all summer long was done; they were tired and sleepy
and glad to go to bed.</p>

<p>When may it be said that the leaves are "fast asleep"?
When they lie quietly on the ground, no longer blown about
by the wind.</p>

<p>How were they kept warm during their long sleep? The
snow came and covered them up warmly, like a "blanket".</p>

<p>What does the whole lesson describe? The falling of the
leaves.</p>

<p>What does the first stanza speak of? The call of the wind.</p>

<p>The second? The answer of the leaves.</p>

<p>The third? The leaves asleep.</p>

<p>Tell the story of the poem in your own words.</p></div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span></p>


<h4><br />PIPING DOWN THE VALLEYS WILD</h4>

<div class='center'>(First Reader, page 52)</div>

<h3>AIM</h3>

<p>To enable the pupils to appreciate the pretty pictures
and the music, and to learn how their pretty songs were
written.</p>

<h3><br />PREPARATION</h3>

<div class="blockquot"><p>In far-away countries there are many sheep, and they
require shepherds. These shepherds, as they can rest while
their sheep feed, sometimes amuse themselves by cutting
oat straws and making them into little flutes. They cut
holes in the straws, just as you see holes in flutes or in tin
whistles. They learn to play very pretty tunes. David,
king of Israel, was, in his youth, a shepherd boy, and he
learned to play beautiful music while he watched his sheep.
The Psalms that you find in the Bible were composed by him.</p></div>

<h3><br />PRESENTATION</h3>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Now let us read about a shepherd who was playing music.
(The teacher reads the poem.) While he was playing, what
did he see? He saw a little child sitting on a cloud.</p>

<p>What was the child doing? He was laughing.</p>

<p>Why? He liked the music.</p>

<p>What kind of music was it? It was pleasant, full of joy.</p>

<p>Where was the shepherd? In a valley.</p>

<p>Tell what the valley was like. It was wild. It had big
rocks and hills on each side, and a cloud was over the valley.</p>

<p>What did the child ask him to do? To play "a song about
a Lamb".</p>

<p>Why did he do that? Because the sheep were pretty and
he thought he should like to hear pretty music about them.</p>

<p>How did the child like it? He asked the shepherd to
play the tune again, and it was such beautiful music that
the keen enjoyment of it made the tears come to his eyes.</p>

<p>What did the child next ask? He wished to have the
music put into words, so he asked the shepherd to "sing" it.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span></p>

<p>How did the child enjoy it? It was so lovely that he
"wept with joy".</p>

<p>What did he ask the shepherd to do? To "write" it
down.</p>

<p>Why? The child thought it was so lovely that he wanted
other children to hear it, too.</p>

<p>Yes, that is the way that we come to have all these pretty
poems in our books. If they were only played or sung, not
so many children could have the opportunity of enjoying
them.</p>

<p>What do you need when you write? We need pens, and
paper, and ink.</p>

<p>The shepherd had not steel pens, and white paper, and
black ink. He may have used the bark of trees to write on.</p>

<p>How did he get a pen? He "plucked a hollow reed", and
he "made a rural pen".</p>

<p>What does that mean? He took a hollow stalk, such as
an oat straw or a weed, and cut it in the form of a pen.</p>

<p>What is a "rural pen"? "Rural" means belonging to
the country. The pen was not made as ours are. The shepherd
wrote about sheep and other things belonging to country
life.</p>

<p>How did he get any ink? He took "water" from the
stream and "stained" it so that it would leave a mark something
like our ink.</p>

<p>Yes, the paper, the pen, and the ink would not be so good
as at present, but they would serve as a beginning.</p></div>


<h3><br />REPRODUCTION</h3>

<div class="blockquot"><p>1. Where was the musician?</p>

<p>2. What kind of instrument was he playing?</p>

<p>3. Where was the child?</p>

<p>4. What was the child's second request?</p>

<p>5. What was his third request?</p>

<p>6. How was the shepherd able to write?</p>

<p>7. Why did the child wish him to write?</p>

<p>(The pupils may not understand "rural", "valley",
"pipes", so the teacher should give such further explanation
as the different cases demand.)</p></div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span></p>


<h4><br />THE BABY SWALLOW</h4>

<div class='center'>(First Reader, page 103)</div>

<p>The aim of this lesson is to teach, by means of a story,
the moral of trusting in God and trying to do one's best.</p>

<p>The teacher should introduce the lesson by inquiring
of the pupils if they have ever watched a young bird
learning to fly. Its timidity and the anxiety of the mother-bird
should be especially emphasized. A brief reference
to the swallow might also be in place, though this is not
essential, as the poet has selected it merely as a type of
birds in general, and almost any other bird would answer
his purpose as well. The rapidity and grace of the
swallow's flight, and its habit of constructing its nest
of mud under the eaves and in other sheltered places
about buildings, are the main points to be noted.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>What is the lesson about? About a baby swallow learning
to fly.</p>

<p>What do the first four stanzas tell us? His fears.</p>

<p>And the last three? The success of his effort.</p>

<p>What do you see in the picture? A tower with a bell in it.</p>

<p>What name is given here for tower? Turret ("Turret"
means a little tower.)</p>

<p>From its sound, what do you think "belfry" means?
The place where the bell is.</p>

<p>What, then, is a "belfry turret"? A tower where a bell
is hung.</p>

<p>On what part of the tower had the bird its nest? The
front.</p>

<p>What word does the poet use to express that? "Breast".</p>

<p>What has been beating against the tower for years? The
wind, sun, rain, snow.</p>

<p>What one word would stand for all these? Weather.</p>

<p>Explain "weather-beaten".</p>

<p>In perching on its nest, what does the baby swallow seem
ready to do? To fly.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span></p>

<p>What other words might the Mother-Bird use instead of
"courage"? "Don't be afraid."</p>

<p>How many wings are meant by "either wing"?</p>

<p>In this stanza, what is the "Mother-Bird" doing? Giving
the little bird instructions in the way to begin flying.</p>

<p>Describe how he is to begin.</p>

<p>How does the baby feel about it? He feels afraid.</p>

<p>What word tells you this? "Pauses."</p>

<p>What does he think is deep? The distance between the
tower and the ground.</p>

<p>Why is the bird afraid to attempt to fly? It is so far
to the ground and his "wings" seem very "small".</p>

<p>Why is the "Mother" not afraid to let her baby try?
She knows that God will carry him safely.</p>

<p>How does she know this? Because "He" had "carried" her.</p>

<p>When? When she was as small as the baby swallow is now.</p>

<p>Why does the "Mother" tell him this? To encourage
him to make the attempt.</p>

<p>How does the baby swallow make his start? He "spreads
out his wings" as far as he can and "springs" out.</p>

<p>Which stanza has almost the same form as this? The
second.</p>

<p>What is he surprised to find? That he is able to fly.</p>

<p>How does he feel after that about flying? He is no
longer afraid.</p></div>

<h3><br />PREPARATION</h3>

<div class="blockquot"><p>What is he able to do well? To steer.</p>

<p>What does this mean? To fly in any direction he wishes.</p>

<p>How does the "Mother" feel over her baby's success?
She feels glad.</p>

<p>To whom does she give thanks? To God.</p>

<p>How does she do so? By singing a song of thankfulness.</p>

<p>What can we learn from this story? That, if we really
try to do a difficult thing, we can usually succeed; that sometimes
a thing that looks hard is really very easy when we
try to do it.</p>

<p>Tell this story in your own words. Tell any similar story
you know.</p></div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span></p>


<h4><br />THE BROOK</h4>

<div class='center'>(First Reader, page 110)</div>

<h3>PREPARATION</h3>

<div class="blockquot"><p>You stood on the bridge and looked at the stream. What
did you see? I saw some little fishes. I saw my image. I
saw some bright stones.</p>

<p>It is no wonder you looked at the stream when it shows
you so many things. What were the fishes doing? They
were swimming. They would dart after some crumbs that
we dropped into the water.</p>

<p>Why were the fishes there? That is their home.</p>

<p>Yes, they like to live in the clear water. Mary says she
saw her image. What have you at home that shows you
your image? The mirror.</p>

<p>Yes, the brook is somewhat like the mirror. Did you see
images of any other things? Yes, I saw images of the trees,
and some stones, and I saw the images of the ducks that
were swimming.</p>

<p>Willie says that he saw some pretty pebbles. Does the
brook make any noise? Yes, it seems to sing when it runs
over the pebbles, but in the deep places it does not make a
noise.</p></div>

<h3><br />PRESENTATION</h3>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Now I shall read you a little poem about a brook. (Read
with emphasis, even with slight exaggeration.) Now, where
did this brook begin? In "a fountain".</p>

<p>What is that? A spring of water.</p>

<p>Where was the fountain? "In a mountain".</p>

<p>What is that? A high hill.</p>

<p>Was it very large where it started? No, the lesson says
it was only "Drops of water" and it trickled "through the
grasses".</p>

<p>What does it mean by "Trickling through the grasses"?
It means that there was so little of it that the blades of grass
seemed almost to check its source.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span></p>

<p>Did it run very fast at first? No, the lesson says that
it "started" "Slow".</p>

<p>Did it run any faster after that? Yes, "Soon it darted",
and it was "Hurrying".</p>

<p>What caused it to dart and hurry? The ground was
steeper, and it had to run more quickly.</p>

<p>Where was it running? Down "to the sea", where it
would be lost in the other water.</p>

<p>Did it grow any larger before it came to the sea? Yes,
it grew "Swift and strong", and it widened "very fast".</p>

<p>What caused it to widen? Other little brooks ran into it
and made it wider.</p>

<p>Now, the brook is said to be like a person. Can you
point out any words that make you think it was like a
person? Yes, it hurries just as children hurry.</p>

<p>In the next stanza, the lesson says it was "Glad". Why
was it glad? It was glad that the "Children" came to play
on its banks.</p>

<p>Yes, it felt just as you feel when your friends come over
to your house to play. Do you see any other words that
make you think it is like a person? Yes, it is "Swift and
strong and happy". It rushes and it sings.</p>

<p>What is it like now? It is like a big, strong, happy boy.</p>

<p>Why did the children come to play on its banks? They
came to pick the flowers.</p>

<p>What line shows you that? "Blossoms floating." The
children picked the flowers and threw some on the stream
to watch the current carry them away.</p>

<p>What else were the children doing? They were sailing
toy boats in the water.</p>

<p>What words show you that? "Mimic boating."</p>

<p>What else did the children enjoy? They liked to see the
"Fishes darting past" them. The fishes were timid.</p>

<p>The brook makes some very pleasant sounds. What
words show you that? "Rippling", "Bubbling", "singing",
"ringing".</p>

<p>When does the water make these sounds? When it is
running "over pebbles" or down the steep places.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span></p>

<p>You must fancy you hear the brook make its gentle
music when it is running over the pebbles. What does the
water look like when it ripples? It is not smooth; it has
tiny waves upon it.</p>

<p>You have heard the water bubble and gurgle, and then,
when the stream grows large and runs faster, you can hear
it "singing" and "ringing" in the distance. The poet tells
us some pretty things about the brook. Tell me some of
them. It was "Cool and clear and free".</p>

<p>Why was it "Cool"? It had flowed among the grasses
and had come from a spring in a mountain.</p>

<p>Why was it "clear"? It was such pure water that you
could see the stones at the bottom of the brook.</p>

<p>Why does the poet say it was "free"? There were no
logs nor big stones to stop its course. It ran freely on its
way.</p>

<p>Do you see any other words that describe its appearance?
It is "Flecked with shade and sun".</p>

<p>Now "Flecked" is a hard word. It means <i>spotted</i> or
<i>striped</i>. Can you tell me what that means? Sometimes the
brook is bright and shining and, in some places, it is shaded
by the trees or by the clouds. You can see bright patches
on the water.</p>

<p>Now you have told me many wonderful things about this
brook; where it began and where it ended, how it grew, how
it sang, how glad it was to see the children, and how the
children played with it, and how it looked. What does it
tell us at first? It tells us where it began.</p>

<p>In the next stanza? It runs a little faster.</p>

<p>In the next? It was glad to see the children.</p>

<p>In the next? The children were playing with it.</p>

<p>In the next? It ran bubbling and singing into the sea.</p></div>


<h3><br />MEMORIZATION</h3>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Now we shall learn the words of this pretty lesson, taking
the first stanza to-day. Let us take the first three lines.
Now all the lines. Let each one be ready to repeat it. See
whether you can say the first stanza to-morrow, and then
we shall learn some more.</p></div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER V</h2>

<h3>FORM II</h3>


<h4>MY SHADOW</h4>

<div class='center'>(Second Reader, page 3)</div>

<h3>AIM</h3>

<p>The aim of the lesson is to make the poem so lifelike that
it will seem to each pupil as though the shadow and the
words were his own.</p>

<h3><br />PRESENTATION</h3>

<p>After the poem has been read to give a general idea
of the story, the teacher should proceed with it in detail,
much in the same spirit as he would carry on a bright
conversation with the pupils about something in which
they were all equally interested.</p>

<div class='center'><br />Stanza I</div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>How do I know my shadow is very fond of me? He
"goes in and out with me".</p>

<p>What does that mean? It means he goes wherever I go.</p>

<p>What is "the use of him"? That "is more than I can
see".</p>

<p>What is he like? He is just "like me from the heels up
to the head".</p>

<p>What does he do when I go to bed? He jumps into bed
"before me".</p></div>

<h3><br />MEMORIZATION</h3>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Now, children, four of you may each recite one line.
What have you, Susie? "I have a little shadow that goes
in and out with me."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span></p>

<p>What is the use of your shadow, John? "And what can
be the use of him is more than I can see."</p>

<p>What is he like, Mary? "He is very, very like me from
the heels up to the head."</p>

<p>When do you see him jump ahead of you? "And I see
him jump before me, when I jump into my bed."</p></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Note.</span>&mdash;Each pupil's expression should reveal an
active imagination and hearty response to the spirit of
the selection. The whole should be very lifelike and real.
Some pupil should be asked to recite or read the whole
stanza.</p>

<div class='center'><br />Stanza II</div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>What is there funny about the shadow? "The funniest
thing about him is the way he likes to grow."</p>

<p>How is that? "He sometimes shoots up" very tall all
at once, and then he dwindles down to nothing.</p>

<p>How would you expect him "to grow"? I would expect
him "to grow" as I do.</p>

<p>How is that? Oh, that is "very slow".</p>

<p>The author says "like proper children". What does that
mean? That means like real children.</p>

<p>What shows that he sometimes grows up very, very
quickly? The poet says he "shoots up".</p>

<p>What other words tell the same thing? "Like an india-rubber
ball."</p>

<p>How is that? The ball goes up quickly with a bounce,
and the shadow seems to spring up in the same way.</p></div>

<h3><br />READING AND MEMORIZATION</h3>

<p>Let two or three children read the stanza. In the
first line, the voice should show how funny it all is; in
the second, the demureness of the "proper" child and
the slowness of the growth should be revealed in the
reading; in the third and fourth lines, there should be
an imitative response to the sudden up-growth of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
shadow and to the childish surprise at his dwindling into
nothing.</p>

<p>Memorization should be conducted as shown in
Stanza I, above. There should be no evidence of task or
effort in the recitation; it is very necessary that it be
spontaneous and full of enjoyment for the pupils.</p>


<div class='center'><br />Stanza III</div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The shadow knows very little about one thing. What
is that? He has no "notion of how children ought to play".</p>

<p>How does he "make a fool of me"? "In every sort of
way."</p>

<p>Well, give one way. He mimics me.</p>

<p>Where does he stay? He stays right "close beside me".</p>

<p>Why does he do that? He does that because "he's a
coward".</p>

<p>How would you feel about doing the same thing? I
would feel ashamed of myself.</p></div>

<p>Reading and recitation of this stanza should now be
conducted as indicated in Stanzas I and II, above.</p>


<div class='center'><br />Stanza IV</div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Did you ever manage to get away from your shadow?
Yes, I did.</p>

<p>Tell us about how you did it. Well, "One morning, very
early", I got up "before the sun" did, and went out in the
flower garden. I looked around for my shadow, and I found
he "had stayed at home behind me" in bed.</p>

<p>What is he called for doing that? He is called "an
arrant sleepy-head".</p>

<p>Give another word in place of "arrant" that will mean
the same thing. He was a thorough and shameless "sleepy-head".</p>

<p>What was the real cause of his staying behind? There
was "none of him at all", because the sun was not up.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span></p>

<p>What will happen when the sun does come up? Then my
shadow will suddenly show himself again.</p>

<p>Now, if you would like to have another stanza, telling
about what happened when the sun came up, just try your
best to write one.</p></div>

<p>Here is another that was written once at the end of
the lesson:</p>

<div class='poem'>
But when the dear old sun came up above the trees,<br />
My frisky little shadow came out into the breeze;<br />
I didn't see him coming, but, when I turned around,<br />
His head was at the window, and he lay along the ground.<br />
</div>


<h4><br />ONE, TWO, THREE</h4>

<div class='center'>(Second Reader, page 21)</div>

<h3>AIM</h3>

<p>To enable the pupils to understand the beauty and
pathos of the selection.</p>

<p>To arouse in them a sympathy for those who are weak.</p>

<h3><br />PREPARATION</h3>

<div class="blockquot"><p>How many of you like to play games? Everybody.</p>

<p>Name some of the games you play. Ball, tag, hide-and-seek,
etc.</p>

<p>With whom do you like to play? With boys and girls of
our own age.</p></div>

<h3><br />PRESENTATION</h3>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Here is a story that tells about two people playing a
game. (The selection is read aloud by the teacher.)</p>

<p>What is the story about? An "old lady" and a little
boy playing "Hide-and-Go-Seek".</p>

<p>What relation were they? The old lady was the boy's
"Grandma".</p>

<p>Let us look at the story again, and see if they enjoyed
their game as much as you do yours. Is there anything in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
the first stanza that tells us they were having a good time?
"The way that they played together was beautiful to see."</p>

<p>What was beautiful about it? They were so kind to each
other. It was pleasant to see an old lady and a little boy
having such a happy time playing together, and understanding
each other so well.</p>

<p>How do you feel, as you read the second stanza? I feel
sorry for the boy because he is lame.</p>

<p>Any other reason for feeling sorry for him? He is "thin",
as though he had been sick a long time.</p>

<p>In what way are he and his Grandma alike? Neither of
them can run or jump.</p>

<p>Do you feel more sorry for the Grandma or for the little
boy? I feel more sorry for the boy, because he may never
be able to run around, and his Grandma could when she was
young.</p>

<p>Describe the picture you see in the third stanza. I see
an old lady and a little boy sitting "under the maple tree".
The little boy has a pair of crutches beside him. The "sunlight"
is shining through the leaves, and it is a warm
summer's day, or they would not be sitting out. There is a
house near them.</p>

<p>What game were they playing? "Hide-and-Go-Seek."</p>

<p>Would you know it from looking at them? No, because
they are sitting still, and when we play the game, we run
around and hide.</p>

<p>How did they play it? They thought in turn of some
place to hide and imagined they were hiding in it; they had
three guesses to find out the place.</p>

<p>Whose turn was it to hide? The old lady's, because the
boy is guessing where she is.</p>

<p>Where did he find her at last? In "Papa's big bed-room",
in "the clothes-press".</p>

<p>Is there anything else spoken about that was in the bed-room?
There was a "little cupboard".</p>

<p>Why does he mention the cupboard? He often thinks of
it. He likes it.</p>

<p>Why? His mother's "things used to be" in it.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span></p>

<p>Why does he say "used to be"? That tells us that they
are not there any longer.</p>

<p>Why? I think his mother is dead.</p>

<p>Who takes care of him now? His grandmother lives with
him and looks after him.</p>

<p>Why does the boy say "It can't be the little cupboard"?
They both think too much of it to want to use it in connection
with their play.</p>

<p>How did the boy enjoy the game? Very much, because
it says he laughed "with glee".</p>

<p>How did the Grandma enjoy it? She was glad to see the
boy happy.</p>

<p>Do old ladies usually like to play games? No, they generally
prefer to read or sew.</p>

<p>Why was she playing with the boy? She loved him and
was sorry he was lame.</p>

<p>Could he do anything for his Grandma? He could talk
to her, and keep her from being lonely. When he grows
older, he can read to her.</p>

<p>Describe the picture you see in the ninth stanza. I see
the old lady, with her hands covering her face, while she
guesses where the boy is hidden.</p>

<p>In the last stanza, why does the author use so many
"olds", in speaking of the Grandmother? He wants to
make us feel she is quite old.</p>

<p>Why does he say "dear" so often? He wants to show
how very kind she was to the lame boy.</p>

<p>Why does he say the boy was "half-past three", instead
of three and a half years old? It sounds better the way he
says it. It suggests the clock's time.</p>

<p>Give me some other titles for this poem. "The Chums",
"A Queer Game", "The Two Playmates".</p></div>


<h4><br />DANDELIONS</h4>

<div class='center'>(Second Reader, page 30)</div>

<h3>AIM</h3>

<p>To lead the pupils to perceive and appreciate how the
poet uses personification and comparison.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span></p>


<h3><br />PRESENTATION</h3>

<p>This poem should be studied in the spring, when the
dandelions are in bloom. A nature study lesson should
precede the literature lesson. The pupils should be required
to observe when the dandelions begin to make
their appearance; at what time of the day they are most
conspicuous; after what kind of night they are to be
found in greatest profusion; what change occurs in the
structure of the flowers as they grow older; how long a
time usually elapses between the first appearance of the
flowers and this change; what the white, downy part
of the flower constitutes; what eventually becomes of this
part.</p>

<p>Introduce the lesson by a brief conversation about
military operations. Describe how one army tries to seize
a strategic position, sometimes a hill, where the men
can fix their guns and command the surrounding country.
If this lesson could be presented without the pupils
knowing the title (by writing the poem on the black-board,
for instance), there would be the added interest
of solving a riddle, namely, what the poet is describing.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>What is a real "trooper band"? A band of soldiers on
horseback.</p>

<p>And what are real "veterans"? Old soldiers who have
seen much service in war.</p>

<p>What is actually meant by the "trooper band"? The
dandelions when they first come out.</p>

<p>What is the phrase that suggests that they are dandelions?
"Yellow coats."</p>

<p>What does the author actually mean by the "veterans"?
The dandelions, when they have gone to seed.</p>

<p>What phrase suggests this? "Their trembling heads and
gray."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span></p>

<p>Where did the "trooper band" make their appearance?
On the hillside.</p>

<p>When? On a "showery night and still".</p>

<p>Why is such a night selected? Because it makes the
dandelions bloom in great numbers.</p>

<p>To what is the coming of the dandelions compared? To
an army taking possession of a hill.</p>

<p>What words tell how they came? "Without a sound of
warning", "surprised", "We were not waked by bugle
notes", "No cheer our dreams invaded".</p>

<p>Explain "surprised the hill". Marched upon it when
they were least expected, and seized it.</p>

<p>Give the meaning of "held it in the morning". Had
undisputed possession of it.</p>

<p>Tell, in your own words, how the dandelions came. Suddenly
and unexpectedly.</p>

<p>How did this attack differ from a real military attack?
There were no notes of the bugle or shouts of the soldiers
to announce the capture of the hill.</p>

<p>Change "No cheer our dreams invaded" into prose order,
and explain the meaning. No cheer invaded our dreams.
Our sleep was not disturbed by the victorious shouts of
soldiers.</p>

<p>How did the coats of the soldiers you have seen differ in
colour from those of the dandelions?</p>

<p>What is the meaning of "at dawn"? The first appearance
of light in the morning.</p>

<p>"Green slopes"? Grassy hillsides.</p>

<p>"Paraded"? Marched up and down.</p>

<p>About what time has elapsed between the incident of the
first stanza and that of the second? Probably a week or thereabouts.</p>

<p>What deed is referred to in the first stanza? The seizure
of the hill.</p>

<p>What is meant by "idly walking"? Without any definite
purpose in view.</p>

<p>"Marked"? Noticed.</p>

<p>About what were the veterans probably "talking"? About
their military exploits in years gone by.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span></p>

<p>What words are suitably used in describing these veterans?
"Trembling" and "gray" suggest old age.</p>

<p>Arrange "their trembling heads and gray" in ordinary
prose order. Their gray and trembling heads.</p>

<p>Why should the veterans be filled with "pride"? Because of the brave deeds they had done.</p>

<p>Why did they laugh? Perhaps, because of some amusing
occurrences they had seen.</p>

<p>What characteristics of the dandelions suggest these
fancies regarding the veterans? The heads of the dandelions
are white. As they sway in the breeze on their slender
stalks, they incline their heads toward one another in much
the same way as people do in conversation.</p>

<p>Why is the "laughter" said to be "noiseless"? Because
human beings could not be expected to hear the laughter of
the dandelions.</p>

<p>What expression would you be likely to use, instead of
"welladay"? Alas!</p>

<p>What is meant by "they blew away"? The seeds of the
flowers were scattered far and wide.</p>

<p>What do you like about this poem? (1) Its charming
poetic fancies. (2) The fitness of the comparisons.</p></div>

<p>Point out clearly how the appearance of the dandelions
resembled a military attack, and how, in the later stage
of their life history, they resembled veteran soldiers.</p>


<h4><br />THE BLIND MEN AND THE ELEPHANT</h4>

<div class='center'>(Second Reader, page 56)</div>

<h3>AIM</h3>

<p>The aim of the lesson should be, not only to lead the
pupils to enjoy the humour of the poem, but also to
appreciate the lesson it teaches. It affords a fine opportunity
for the development of conversational powers in
the pupils.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span></p>

<p>The pupils should be encouraged to talk freely, and
the questions should often call for quite lengthy answers.</p>


<h3><br />PREPARATION</h3>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Who has seen an elephant? You have, Henry? Well,
tell us something about him. He was very large. One of
our barn doors is twelve feet high and six feet wide, and
father said the elephant would just be able to go through
that door. If he was in the school-room, his back would
reach almost to the ceiling. His ears were bigger than the
top of my desk. His trunk was twice as long as father's
cane, and was nearly as big around at the upper end as a
bag of wheat, and the lower end was as small as my leg is
below the knee. His tusks were hard and white, one on each
side of his trunk, and were longer than father's arm. His
tail was small. It did not seem to be as long as one of his
tusks. His legs were larger around than the trunk of the
biggest apple tree in our orchard. His skin was something
like a hog's skin, only thicker, and he had no hair. His
whole body was a dirty, dark colour.</p>

<p>That is a fairly good description, Henry. You have helped
us to picture a very large elephant.</p></div>


<h3><br />PRESENTATION</h3>

<div class="blockquot"><p>As you have read this poem to yourselves, tell me what
it is about. It is about six blind men "Who went to see the
elephant".</p>

<p>As they were blind, how could they see him? They couldn't
see him as we do, but they could feel him, and that was to
them what seeing is to us.</p>

<p>In what way was feeling the same to them as seeing is
to us? It was their way of knowing the animal, and that is
just what seeing is to us.</p>

<p>Where did this happen? It happened in Indostan.</p>

<p>I told you to look for Indostan in Asia. Point it out on
the map. (A pupil points to it.)</p>

<p>What are we told about these men? They gave much of
their time to study.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span></p>

<p>What do you suppose was their favourite way of finding
out things? This lesson makes me think that they liked to
find out things by their own efforts.</p>

<p>Why do you think that? Because it says that they wanted
to "satisfy" their minds by their own "observations".</p>

<p>In what other ways do boys and girls satisfy their minds
about new things? By asking questions about them until
the answers satisfy them.</p>

<p>What other way do you use sometimes? We read books to
learn about many new things.</p>

<p>What did the first man learn? He thought he had learned
that the elephant was "like a wall".</p>

<p>Why do you say thought? He hadn't really learned it.
He stopped making observations just as soon as he had one
idea.</p>

<p>Why do you think he did that? I think he was in a hurry
to be the first to state what he knew.</p>

<p>What words in the poem suggest that idea to you? The
words "At once began to bawl".</p>

<p>How did this man come to think the elephant was "like
a wall"? He fell against the animal's huge side, and it made
him think of a wall.</p>

<p>What was the second man's opinion about the elephant?
He thought the animal was "like a spear".</p>

<p>Account for that idea. He felt one of the elephant's
tusks, and formed his opinion without going any further.</p>

<p>And what about the third man? The third man put his
hands on the elephant's trunk and felt it all over, but as he
did not go any further, he declared that the elephant was
"like a snake", because it was the only thing, as far as he
knew, that squirmed about as the trunk did.</p>

<p>What did the fourth man do? The fourth man felt the
big front legs and declared the elephant was "like a tree".</p>

<p>Tell us about the fifth man. The fifth man happened to
touch the ear. He felt all over it but nowhere else, so he said
the elephant was "like a fan".</p>

<p>And what had the sixth man to say? The sixth man had
caught hold of the elephant's tail, and when he had felt all
over it, he declared the elephant was "like a rope".<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span></p>

<p>What conclusion did they come to in the end? They
didn't come to any conclusion. They argued and argued for
a long time, and each man was stubborn and stuck to "his
own opinion".</p></div>


<h3><br />GENERALIZATION</h3>

<div class="blockquot"><p>In what respects were they all alike?</p>

<p>1. Each one felt just one part of the animal and took the
part for the whole.</p>

<p>2. Each was in a hurry to give his opinion and did not
take time to form a good one.</p>

<p>3. Each man was stubborn and probably refused to feel
where the others had felt.</p>

<p>If they could be in your place, how would they see themselves?
They would see how foolish they had been, and each
would see that the others were as nearly right as he himself
was.</p>

<p>What lesson for ourselves can we learn from this? It
teaches us not to be in a hurry in giving our opinions.</p>

<p>What do we learn from the dispute mentioned in the last
verse? We learn from it that, when our own opinions about
anything are firmly fixed, it does no good to argue about the
matter.</p>

<p>In what way could they have arrived at the same conclusions?
If each had done all that each of the others did,
they would have agreed about the elephant.</p>

<p>In what way were these men really blind? They could
not, or would not, see the viewpoint of others. There may
be a mental blindness, as well as a physical blindness.</p>

<p>Here are two lines that you may memorize, as they fit the
lesson very well:</p>

He's of the same opinion still.<br />

<h4><br />THE LORD IS MY SHEPHERD</h4>

<div class='center'>(Second Reader, page 203)</div>


<h3>AIM</h3>

<p>To lead the pupils to appreciate the beauty and power
of the language of this Biblical lesson, and to feel a confidence
in God's protection and support.</p>


<h3><br />PRESENTATION</h3>

<p>The teacher should talk with the pupils about the
great flocks of sheep in Eastern lands. They require a
shepherd to lead them to pastures where the grass is long
and sweet, and to protect them from the wild animals.</p>

<p>This Psalm is called the "Shepherd Psalm" because
it was written by David, after he became a king. He
remembered the time when he was a shepherd boy and
used to spend his days and nights in the fields with the
sheep, and how he once killed a lion and a bear that came
to attack his flock; and he thought to himself that God
had cared for him all his life just as he himself used to
care for his little lambs, so at last he put his thoughts into
the words of this Twenty-third Psalm.</p>

<p>There are two metaphors in this Psalm. In the first
is developed, through the figure of a shepherd and his
flock, God's care of His people.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>What are the feelings of the sheep toward the shepherd?
They feel confident that he will supply them with food; he
will lead them to the "green pastures" and to the "still
waters" by the wells and fountains, where they will neither
hunger nor thirst.</p>

<p>What does the expression "lie down" infer? A sense of
rest and security. The sheep can lie down in the "green<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
pastures" and feel confident that the shepherd is able and
willing to protect them from danger.</p>

<p>In what way do we resemble the sheep? We are dependent
upon the Lord for our supply of spiritual and material needs,
and for guidance and protection along the path of everyday
life.</p>

<p>What does the Psalmist mean when he says: "He restoreth
my soul"? "Soul" means, in Hebrew, the "life,"
or "one's self". The Lord restores and brings back His
people, when wandering into forbidden places.</p>

<p>Explain the next line. As the shepherd goes before and
leads his sheep by the right paths, avoiding all dangers, so
the Lord leads His people into "the paths of righteousness".</p>

<p>What does "for His name's sake" mean? He has undertaken
to guide His people safely and will do it for the honour
of His name.</p>

<p>In the next section, whom is the Psalmist addressing?
He is speaking to the Lord.</p>

<p>What words show that he is still using the figure of the
shepherd and the sheep? "Through the valley"; "Thy rod
and thy staff".</p>

<p>What does the first line mean? Some paths that are right
paths for us to walk in still lead through perilous places; and
this is the way the Psalmist refers to this fact in shepherd life.</p>

<p>How should we feel? The Lord accompanies us, and we
should "fear no evil". The sheep follow the shepherd with
absolute confidence, and our attitude toward "the Good Shepherd"
should be the same.</p>

<p>What words show that danger is sometimes close? Death
sometimes comes so close that it almost seems to cast a
shadow.</p>

<p>What does the "rod" represent? The rod is the sign of
authority, and represents the defence and protection afforded
by the shepherd to the sheep, when in danger from robbers
or wild beasts.</p>

<p>What does the "staff" represent? The staff denotes support
and guidance, and is used for aiding the sheep in places
of need, even along peaceful ways. The expression "Thy rod
and thy staff" covers the whole round of protecting care.</p></div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span></p>

<p>Here the figure is changed. In the second metaphor
God is represented as a host with the Psalmist as a guest
at a banquet.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Thou preparest a table before me." The Lord makes
provision for man's needs. He does so openly, publicly ("in
the presence of mine enemies").</p>

<p>In what other way does the Lord show His care for His
people? The Psalmist says: "Thou hast anointed my head
with oil."</p>

<p>To what does this refer? In the East, it was the custom
to pour an ointment of great fragrance on the heads of the
guests of honour at a feast.</p>

<p>How does the Psalmist further picture the goodness of
God? He fills our "cup" till it is overflowing.</p>

<p>What is the thought in the last two lines? The confidence
of the Psalmist in the Lord, that as He has led and
guided him in the past, so His "goodness and mercy" "shall
follow" him "all the days of his life," and he will live forever
in intimate communion with Him.</p>

<p>What do you like about the selection? The spirit of gratitude
and confidence in those who enjoy God's benefits. The
nature of some of these benefits is made plain to us by the
pictures of the "green pastures", the "still waters", "the
rod and staff", and the prepared "table".</p></div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI</h2>

<h3>FORM III</h3>


<h4>HIDE AND SEEK</h4>

<div class='center'>(Third Reader, page 50)</div>


<h3>AIM</h3>

<p>To lead the pupils to appreciate the exquisite music
of the language and the pathos of the story.</p>


<h3><br />PRESENTATION</h3>

<div class="blockquot"><p>What does the poem describe? It describes a father's love
for his son.</p>

<p>There are two distinct parts. What does each part
describe? The first two stanzas describe a game of "Hide
and Seek" between the father and the boy, and the last
two, the father's intense longing for the boy whom he has
lost.</p>

<p>What kind of day is described in the first stanza? A
bright and calm June day.</p>

<p>What things suggest this? Sleeping trees, still winds,
wandering clouds, "noonday silence".</p>

<p>What does the writer represent the trees and the winds
to be? Persons&mdash;the trees having the ability to sleep, and
the winds to move or keep still. This is called personification.</p>

<p>What are "fleecy clouds"? Clouds that are white and
downy.</p>

<p>The poet speaks of them as "flocks". What is the comparison
intended? The comparison of the clouds to flocks
of white sheep that, instead of wandering across a meadow,
are wandering across the sky.</p>

<p>What does the word "wandered" suggest? That the clouds
are moving along slowly and leisurely without any purpose
in view. They are doing this because the "winds are still".<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span></p>

<p>What is meant by saying that they "Have wandered past
the hill"? They have gone below the horizon at the hilltop
and cannot be seen. The sky is thus clear of clouds.</p>

<p>What causes "the noonday silence"? The heat of the
mid-day has silenced even the songs of the birds. Compare
Keats:</p>

<div class='poem'>
When all the birds are faint with the hot sun<br />
And hide in cooling trees.<br />
</div>

<p>How is the silence broken? By the voice of the little boy
hunting for his father.</p>

<p>What do the words of the tune he is singing constitute?
The rules of the game. The one hiding must respond
"Coo-ee" each time the one searching calls.</p>

<p>Where is his father? In a "leafy nook" in the woods.</p>

<p>What does the question "Shall I let him pass?" seem to
indicate? That his father hesitates for a moment to reveal
himself.</p>

<p>What does he do, however? He gives the boy the signal&mdash;a
"low, soft whistle". He cannot "let him pass".</p>

<p>What is shown in the last long line of the stanza? That
the man enters into the spirit of the game with the same
zest as the boy.</p>

<p>What feeling exists between the two? A feeling of perfect
good-fellowship and affection.</p>

<p>Explain, "you're it". Your turn to hunt, mine to hide.</p>

<p>What further rules of the game are given here? (Every
boy and girl will know these.)</p>

<p>What change in feeling is there between the first two
stanzas and the last two? A sudden transition from gaiety
and light-heartedness to sorrow.</p>

<p>What has happened? The boy is dead.</p>

<p>Why is "Long ago" repeated? It emphasizes the idea and
adds to the pathos of the line. The time has seemed long
because of the intensity of the father's grief. Happiness
makes time pass quickly, not so grief.</p>

<p>How does the poet suggest the idea that the game is still
being continued though it is now an inexpressibly sad one?
He speaks of the boy as having left his father as if to hide,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
of his father as seeking him "high and low", of his being
safely "hidden" "in some pleasant place", of the father as
being unable to hear his "Coo-ee".</p>

<p>What is really meant by seeking him "high and low"?
The thought of his boy is ever with him. He unconsciously
looks for his face wherever he goes.</p>

<p>What is the "pleasant place"? Paradise.</p>

<p>How could you describe the short lines, "Far away", etc.,
down to the end of the stanza? As the call of a broken heart
to the boy.</p>

<p>Where is the idea contained in "Far away" expressed
before? In "Hidden safe and happy in some pleasant place".</p>

<p>And where is the thought, "Many a day", repeated?
"Long ago he left me, long and long ago."</p>

<p>How is the father continually reminded of his boy? By
the "Birds" and "Flowers"&mdash;everything that he loved is
charged with memories of him.</p>

<p>What light is thrown upon the little fellow's interests?
He loved the out-of-doors, the things of nature.</p>

<p>What ray of sunshine breaks through the clouds of the
father's grief? The conviction that his boy "is waiting" for
him till he comes.</p>

<p>What is the meaning of the line, "Love may hide itself",
etc.? The little boy's love may for the moment be hidden,
but it is everlasting. The father's love is likewise everlasting.
This is sufficient ground for believing that they will some
day be united.</p></div>

<p>The reading of this poem by the pupils will show
whether they feel its joy, its sadness, and its hope.</p>


<h4><br />AN APPLE ORCHARD IN THE SPRING</h4>

<div class='center'>(Third Reader, page 60)</div>

<h3>AIM</h3>

<p>To lead the pupils to appreciate the beauty of an
apple orchard in the spring and the music of the language
used in describing it.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span></p>


<h3><br />PREPARATION</h3>

<p>This lesson should be taken when the apple orchards
are in bloom. The teacher should prepare the pupils for
it, by asking them to observe the blossoms, their colours
and odours, the songs of the birds, and the sounds of the
streams.</p>

<h3><br />PRESENTATION</h3>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Read the poem describing these. What is the main theme
of the lesson? The poet tells us how much we have missed
if we have not "seen an apple orchard in the spring".</p>

<p>What is his theme in the first three stanzas? The beauty
of an apple orchard.</p>

<p>What, in the last stanza? His memory of it.</p>

<p>In what order does he describe the blossoms? In the first
stanza, the buds are turning white; in the second, they are
unfolding; and in the third, the petals are dropping.</p>

<p>Where does the author suppose the reader to be standing,
in the first stanza? Outside the orchard, where it is possible
to see "the spreading trees" and all the orchard at once.</p>

<p>Where, in the next two stanzas, is he supposed to be? He
is plucking the blossoms and walking under the trees.</p>

<p>What senses are appealed to in the first stanza? Sight&mdash;"seen
an apple orchard". Hearing&mdash;"mavis sings its story".</p>

<p>What senses are appealed to in the second stanza? Touch&mdash;"plucked
the apple blossoms", "touch them a delight".
Smell&mdash;"caught their subtle odours". Sight&mdash;"Pink buds
pouting at the light", "Crumpled petals baby white".</p>

<p>What senses are appealed to in the third? Sight&mdash;"pink
cascades". Hearing&mdash;"silver brooklets brawling", "cuckoo
bird soft calling".</p>

<p>Show the appropriateness of "hoary", "wealth of promised
glory", "pouting", "pink cascades", "silver brooklets
brawling", "wonder of the spring", "precious", "tender".</p>

<p>What Canadian birds could be substituted for the mavis
and the cuckoo? The robins, warblers, and goldfinches.</p></div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span></p>

<p>Lead the pupils to examine the arrangement of the
rhythm and the refrain, so that they will appreciate the
music of the verse. Let each pupil show his appreciation
by reading the stanza he likes best.</p>


<h4><br />LITTLE DAFFYDOWNDILLY</h4>

<div class='center'>(Third Reader, page 223)</div>

<p>The teacher should require the pupils to read the
lesson through and then to reproduce its main incidents
without any regard to their allegorical significance. Such
headings as the following might be suggested by the
pupils, and these would serve to guide in this reproduction:</p>

<p>1. Daffydowndilly's dislike of the schoolmaster</p>

<p>2. His decision to run away from school</p>

<p>3. His meeting with the stranger who accompanies
him on his journey</p>

<p>4. The haymakers</p>

<p>5. The carpenters</p>

<p>6. The soldiers</p>

<p>7. The merry-makers</p>

<p>8. His discovery of his companion's identity</p>

<p>9. The lesson that he learned.</p>

<p>Having thus obtained the literal meaning of the story&mdash;a
matter of little difficulty&mdash;it remains to get its deeper
significance. It is hardly probable that many pupils will
be disposed to regard the story as literally true, yet few
will be likely, upon a first reading, to see the principle
that underlies it. In order to arrive at this, the teacher
may proceed as follows:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Are there any parts of the story that strike you as improbable?
(1) The reference to Mr. Toil's long residence
upon the earth. (2) The frequent meetings with Mr. Toil's
brothers. (3) Daffydowndilly's slowness in discovering
another brother in the person of his companion. (4) Their
travelling all day in a circle.</p>

<p>If the story is literally untrue or improbable, what object
might Hawthorne have had in view in writing it? Perhaps
he wished to teach some lesson; perhaps there is a meaning
hidden beneath the story.</p>

<p>Let us discover what that hidden meaning is? What
does the name "Toil" suggest to you? Work.</p>

<p>What, then, may Mr. Toil represent? Work.</p>

<p>And what may his brothers represent? Different kinds
of work.</p>

<p>With this idea in mind, we shall now try to understand
what each adventure really means. How are we prepared
for Daffydowndilly's troubles with the schoolmaster and for
his later unpleasant experience? The author tells us that he
"took no delight in labour of any kind".</p>

<p>What flower did he resemble? The daffodil. The boy's
name is another form of the name of the flower.</p>

<p>In what respect is he said to resemble a flower? He
"loved to do only what was beautiful and agreeable, and
took no delight in labour of any kind".</p>

<p>Why is Mr. Toil first represented as a schoolmaster? Because
it is at school that a boy is first introduced to real
work. (This might be given a still more extended meaning.
The school represents the preparation for our future vocation,
whether it be in the school-room, or in an apprenticeship, or
elsewhere. This involves hard work, and hence is, to some
extent, at least, unpleasant.)</p>

<p>What is meant by saying that Mr. Toil "had done more
good ... than anybody else in the world"? Work does
everybody good: (1) It keeps us out of mischief. Criminals
often become so because of the lack of profitable employment.
(2) It improves character. The people of the best and
strongest character are those who have had to work hard.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
(3) It makes the world happier. The most miserable people
are those who have nothing to do.</p>

<p>"A very worthy character." Is "character" used in its
usual sense here? It usually means what a person really <i>is</i>.</p>

<p>(Distinguish "character" and "reputation".)</p>

<p>Explain what is meant by saying that "he had dwelt upon
earth ever since Adam was driven from the garden of Eden".
Ever since that time man has had to work. God said to
Adam (Genesis iii, 19), "In the sweat of thy face shalt thou
eat bread".</p>

<p>Why is Mr. Toil represented as being such a disagreeable
person? Because, to some people, work has many unpleasant
features.</p>

<p>Any activity that has no compulsory elements in it is no
longer work, but play. What is the real meaning of the
paragraph describing the schoolmaster's method of discipline?
The work of the school-room, being compulsory, and therefore
disagreeable to idle boys, becomes exceedingly painful
when long continued.</p>

<p>Contrast Daffydowndilly's previous life with his experience
at school. Brought up under the indulgence of his mother,
his life had been very pleasant. Now, introduced to real
work, he finds life very unpleasant.</p>

<p>What gives us a suggestion as to the identity of the
stranger whom Daffydowndilly met on the road? We are
told that he was "trudging" "along the road", and that his
voice "seemed hard and severe".</p>

<p>Why is "trudging" a better word than "walking"? It
suggests effort, and hence work.</p>

<p>How does the form of the question, "Whence do you come
so early, and whither are you going?" harmonize with the
description of the stranger?</p>

<p>We are told that he had a "grave and sedate appearance",
and the somewhat stilted form of the question is quite in
harmony with this description.</p>

<p>Why had his voice "a sort of kindness in it"? Because
moderate work, such as this walking early in the day, is not
altogether unpleasant.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span></p>

<p>Explain "ingenuous disposition". How does Daffydowndilly
show this?</p>

<p>What made his discovery of Mr. Toil among the labourers
in the hayfield so unexpected? The circumstances and surroundings&mdash;"the
sunshine", "the blue sky", the singing
birds, the fragrant hay&mdash;were so pleasant that it was hard
to see how anything so unpleasant as work could intrude
there.</p>

<p>Why is Mr. Toil recognized in the owner of the field
rather than among the labourers? In directing the activities
of the men, as well as working himself, he is performing the
most arduous labour of all.</p>

<p>Why does the stranger say the farmer is a "more disagreeable
man" than his brother, the schoolmaster? Because
the activities of farm life are more laborious than those
of the school-room.</p>

<p>What expression that takes the form of a proverb is used
in describing this incident? "To make hay while the sun
shone."</p>

<p>Distinguish its meaning, as the author uses it, from its
meaning as a proverb. The author uses it in its literal
meaning. The farmer must make the most of fine weather
and sunshine in curing ("making") his hay, for, if rain
comes after it is cut, it will be more or less injured. Used
as a proverb, the expression means that one should seize
the opportunities presented and make the most of them.</p>

<p>What does Hawthorne mean by placing a Mr. Toil at the
head of the company of soldiers? Military movements,
though very attractive to the eye, really involve work.
Soldiers find their activities very toilsome, especially after
the novelty has worn off.</p>

<p>Why is Mr. Toil placed even among the dancers? The
pursuit of pleasure soon becomes wearisome, and hence toilsome.</p>

<p>Why is the fiddler represented as a Frenchman? France,
as a whole, is reputed to be the gayest and sprightliest of
nations.</p>

<p>What is meant by saying that "those who have known
him best think him still more disagreeable than his brothers"?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
Those who devote themselves entirely to the pursuit of
pleasure find it more toilsome and disagreeable than ordinary
work. People frequently say, after a day given up to pleasure,
that they are more tired than if they had worked hard all
day.</p>

<p>In which of the incidents of the story does it seem least
likely that Mr. Toil would be met with? In the incident of
the merry-makers.</p>

<p>In which, most likely? The incident of the haymakers.</p>

<p>How has Hawthorne apparently arranged Daffydowndilly's
experiences? He has so arranged them that in each
successive incident we are more surprised at meeting with
Mr. Toil. Each one seems to promise less probability of his
presence than the preceding.</p>

<p>Why had Daffydowndilly not recognized his companion
before? His voice had been kind and his manner agreeable
in the early stages of the journey.</p>

<p>Interpret this as has been done in the case of the other
incidents. The early part of Daffydowndilly's journey had
been pleasant, owing to the freedom from school and the
interesting experiences by the way. But, as the day drew
on, he gradually grew tired, and then it was that he recognized
that walking is work.</p>

<p>What lesson did he learn? That he could not get away
from work. It is to be found everywhere, in the most unexpected
places, and one cannot escape from it by changing
his occupation.</p>

<p>What is meant by Daffydowndilly's finding Mr. Toil's
ways more agreeable upon better acquaintance? When he
grew accustomed to his work, he found that it was not so
very unpleasant after all; "that diligence is not a whit more
toilsome than sport or idleness".</p>

<p>What is Mr. Toil's "smile of approbation"? The consciousness
of work well done.</p></div>

<p>Tell the pupils that this story is an Allegory. They
have probably read other stories of a similar nature, and
may be asked to frame a simple definition. An Allegory
is a story, not literally true, containing incidents that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
have a deeper meaning than is apparent on the surface.
Its purpose is to teach some moral truth or universal
principle. It differs from the Parable in being longer
and more complex.</p>

<p>When the pupils reproduce the story, it will be well
to adhere to the allegorical form, and not attempt to give
its significance.</p>


<h4><br />MOONLIGHT SONATA</h4>

<div class='center'>(Third Reader, page 285)</div>

<h3>AIM</h3>

<p>To lead the pupils to appreciate the importance of
details in the construction of a story.</p>

<h3><br />PREPARATION</h3>

<p>The teacher will have told the pupils a few facts about
Beethoven and, if possible, will have shown them his
picture. He will also have asked them to read the lesson
at home and become familiar with the story.</p>

<h3><br />PRESENTATION</h3>

<div class="blockquot"><p>What is the main point in the story? The circumstances
under which the musician wrote the "Moonlight Sonata".</p>

<p>What is a sonata? It is a musical composition which
consists of movements fast or slow, sad or playful, according
to the varying mood of the composer.</p>

<p>Where was the scene? In Bonn in Prussia.</p>

<p>When? On a moonlight winter's evening.</p>

<p>Who were the two persons? Beethoven and the writer.</p>

<p>Notice that these three important facts are all told briefly
at the beginning.</p>

<p>Why had the writer called on the musician? He wished
to take him for a walk and afterwards take him home with
him to supper.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span></p>

<p>Had he any reason except the desire for Beethoven's company?
Yes, Beethoven's health was not good, his hearing
was becoming impaired, and the writer evidently thought he
needed rest and recreation. These circumstances led to an
important result.</p>

<p>What happened next? In passing through a narrow street,
Beethoven heard some one playing his "Sonata in F".</p>

<p>What were his feelings? Surprise to hear it in such a
place and delight at the excellence of the playing.</p>

<p>How did he show his feelings? By exclamations, questions,
and short sentences.</p>

<p>What is told in the next three paragraphs? They describe
a conversation.</p>

<p>Who are speaking? A brother and sister.</p>

<p>What are they saying? The sister is lamenting that she
cannot "go to the concert at Cologne" and her brother reminds
her of their poverty. Then she wishes that "for once
in her life" she "could hear some really good music".</p>

<p>What happens next? Beethoven decides to enter the house.</p>

<p>How does the writer impress this fact on the reader? By
giving the argument between himself and Beethoven.</p>

<p>What were the latter's reasons? The player had "feeling,
genius, understanding", and these qualities are so rarely
found that Beethoven could not neglect them.</p>

<p>Explain these terms. The player showed refined feeling
in her interpretation of the music, genius in her skill on
the piano, and thorough understanding of the composer's
purposes in the composition.</p>

<p>Was it only for his own pleasure that the composer
entered? No, he wished to give pleasure to one who could
so well appreciate his work.</p>

<p>Describe the scene. A young shoemaker is seated at his
work. He is pale from the effects of confinement and toil.
A young girl with an abundance of light hair is leaning on
an "old-fashioned piano".</p>

<p>What does this piano show? That their parents had very
probably been lovers of music, and the piano may have been
an heirloom.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span></p>

<p>What comes next? The musician explains the reasons for
his intrusion.</p>

<p>How did the brother look upon it? The young man
seemed annoyed at first.</p>

<p>How was this annoyance overcome? The manner of
Beethoven was so comical and pleasant that the young man's
annoyance passed away.</p>

<p>How had Beethoven addressed the brother and sister?
His manner was very confused. He wished to conceal his
name, and yet wished to give pleasure to the young girl.</p>

<p>How does he show his confusion? The sentences "I, I
also ... play for you", are such halting ones. He does
not make his sentences complete.</p>

<p>What was the next part of the conversation? The young
man tells Beethoven that the "piano is so wretched" and
they "have no music".</p>

<p>What is the purpose of this statement in the story? It
shows Beethoven that the young girl is blind and plays these
difficult compositions by ear.</p>

<p>How had she learned to play this Sonata? She had heard
a lady "practising" it, and "walked to and fro" in front of
the house in order "to listen to it".</p>

<p>What does this show? What a love of music and wonderful
natural ability the young girl possessed.</p>

<p>What is the next action in the story? Beethoven plays.</p>

<p>Why did he play better than he had often done before
large audiences? He realized how greatly his work was
appreciated; and he was deeply touched by the thought of
the young girl's blindness, her poverty, her skill, and her
passion for good music.</p>

<p>What trifling occurrence now affects the story? The last
candle in the house burned out, so the writer opened the
shutters and admitted "a flood of brilliant moonlight".</p>

<p>What effect had this upon the composer? It changed the
current of his thoughts and feelings.</p>

<p>How did he appear? "His head dropped upon his breast",
and "his hands rested upon his knees".</p>

<p>What is the next action? The young shoemaker asks
Beethoven who he is.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span></p>

<p>What did the composer answer? "He played the opening
bars of the Sonata in F." This revealed his name. The
writer says that the young people "covered his hands with
tears and kisses".</p>

<p>What were their feelings? Their actions were expressions
of their affection and admiration.</p>

<p>What takes place next? The brother and sister beseech
him to play "once more".</p>

<p>What description is given here? Beethoven's appearance
in the moonlight.</p>

<p>Describe him. He was very "massive" in size, his head
was large and his features strong, and the light from the
moon encircled his head. (Produce a picture, if possible, of
Beethoven.)</p>

<p>Did he agree to play again? Yes, he said he would "improvise
a Sonata to the Moonlight".</p>

<p>What does "improvise" mean? He would compose the
music as he played.</p>

<p>Had this any relation to what goes before? Yes, the
writer has told us how thoughtful he had been when the
moonlight first streamed into the room. Now he is going
to express his thoughts and feelings through the tones of
the piano.</p>

<p>We said at the beginning that a Sonata was a musical
composition consisting of various movements. What are the
movements? In this case there is first, "a sad and infinitely
lovely movement", then, "a wild, elfin passage in triple
time", and lastly, "a breathless, hurrying, trembling" close.</p>

<p>Let us examine this description of the "Moonlight Sonata"
more closely. What did the moonlight suggest to Beethoven?
"Spirits" dancing in the moonlight.</p>

<p>What does the first movement suggest? The "moonlight"
flowing "over the dark earth".</p>

<p>What does the second movement suggest? The wild dance
of the "spirits on the lawn".</p>

<p>What does the last suggest? "Flight", "uncertainty",
"impulsive terror".</p>

<p>What was the effect upon the listeners? They were left
in a state of "wonder" and "emotion".<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span></p>

<p>What musical terms are used to describe this music?
<i>Interlude</i>, <i>triple time</i>, <i>agitato finale</i>.</p>

<p>Explain them. <i>Interlude</i> is a piece of music played between
the main parts. <i>Triple time</i> is time, or rhythm, of
three beats, or of three times three beats in a bar.</p>

<p>Give an example of triple time. It denotes sprightliness,
as in the waltz. The <i>agitato finale</i> means the close of the
passage with a hurrying movement.</p>

<p>What takes place next? Beethoven rose quickly, promised
to come again, and hurried away.</p>

<p>Why did he hurry? He wished to write out the "Sonata"
while it was still fresh in his mind.</p>

<p>What does the last short paragraph state? It tells that
this was the origin of the "Moonlight Sonata".</p>

<p>Where is the theme of the whole lesson found? In the
last sentence.</p>

<p>What has the writer told us? He has given us all the
circumstances which combined to inspire Beethoven to compose
this great work.</p></div>

<h3><br />RECAPITULATION</h3>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Now let us review the story and collect these details.
What are they? The time, place, the persons going for a
walk, the narrow street, the wonderful playing, the conversation,
the appearance of the young people, the blindness of
the girl, her eagerness to hear "good music", the moonlight
admitted, the recognition of Beethoven.</p>

<p>Yes, all these things had a combined effect upon the
musician. If he had gone straight to supper, there would
probably not have been a "Moonlight Sonata". This lesson
illustrates how time, place, persons, and action are arranged
to produce a well-told story.</p></div>


<h4><br />LEAD, KINDLY LIGHT</h4>

<div class='center'>(Third Reader, page 315)</div>

<h3>AIM</h3>

<p>To aid in the culture of a sensitive response to the
spirit and language of the prayer.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span></p>


<h3><br />PREPARATION</h3>

<p>The teacher should talk with the pupils about a
journey through the darkness, over dangerous bogs,
swollen streams, and beside precipices.</p>


<h3>PRESENTATION</h3>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Read the poem. In what form is this lesson? A prayer.</p>

<p>What is the prayer? The traveller asks for the guidance
of the Holy Spirit. See notes on this lesson in the Manual on
<i>The Ontario Readers</i>, pp. 166-7.</p>

<p>Describe his journey. "The night is dark", he is "far
from home", he trusts to the light shining through the darkness
to keep his feet from stumbling; he does not trouble
himself about what lies far before him, he attends only to his
footsteps one by one. He feels he can pass safely over the
"moor", the "fen", the "crag", and the "torrent", by
trusting to the guidance of the light. With the dawning of
the day will come the reunion with his loved ones from
whom he has been separated.</p>

<p>Explain the symbolism employed here. The poet speaks
of himself as going through life like a traveller on a long
journey, wherein he is constantly met by trials and temptations
and cannot always know what is the right course to
take. He acknowledges that he needs some stronger power
than his own to direct his life and asks for the guidance of
the Holy Spirit, content to trust himself to His leading in
any dangers and difficulties that may arise in this life, and
secure in the knowledge that "with the morn" he shall see
once more those whom he has "loved" and "lost awhile".</p>

<p>What is the main thought of the first stanza? The
traveller prays for guidance.</p>

<p>Of the second stanza? He states that he has not always
been willing to ask for guidance, but had relied on his own
reason.</p>

<p>Of the third stanza? He expresses his belief in the power
and willingness of God to guide him aright.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span></p>

<p>What is the relation of the second stanza to the first
one? It contrasts the poet's earlier attitude of mind toward
God with that of later years, thus emphasizing the change
that has taken place in his life.</p>

<p>Is the poet stronger in the second case than in the first?
No; in the first, his ideal is higher and his humility greater,
as he relies absolutely on the guidance of the Holy Spirit.
In the second, relying only on his own reasoning powers to
guide him, he made many humiliating failures.</p>

<p>Image the "moor", the "fen", the "crag", the "torrent",
and "with the morn".</p></div>


<h3>RECAPITULATION</h3>

<p>Summarize the main thoughts and lead the pupils to
bring out clearly the comparison between the traveller
and the poet.</p>

<p>Give a brief account of the author's life.</p>




<h4><br />LEAD, KINDLY LIGHT</h4>

<div class="center">(Third Reader, page 315)</div>


<h3>AIM</h3>

<p>To aid in the culture of a sensitive response to the
spirit and language of the prayer.</p>


<h3><br />TREATMENT</h3>

<p>The teacher should read the poem aloud, to awaken
respect for the deep humility, complete open-mindedness,
and growing faith of the poet.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>What may this poem be called? A prayer for guidance.</p></div>


<div class='center'><br />Stanza I</div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>What are the poet's feelings? He feels very much depressed
in spirit, as a traveller would who was far from
home and alone in the gathering darkness.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span></p>

<p>Whom does he address as "Kindly Light"? Why does
he use the term "Light"? He may remember that our
Saviour called Himself "the Light of the world", and it is
as his "Light" or Guide that the traveller feels his need of
Him. He may be thinking of the Pillar of Fire and the Pillar
of Cloud.</p>

<p>What image is suggested by the words "Lead, kindly
Light"? It suggests something that has life (moves on before),
and sheds a beneficent light on the travellers' path.</p>

<p>What is meant by the "gloom"? It means the condition
of his mind. He is seeking Truth and feels that he cannot
rely on reason alone to guide him.</p>

<p>What do the last two lines show about him? They show
that he is humble and is content to be guided through the
darkness "one step" at a time.</p></div>

<div class='center'><br />Stanza II</div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>What more do we learn about his life in the second
stanza? In what language is his former "pride" contrasted
with his present humility? What is the meaning of "garish"?
What part of his life is called "the garish day"? Why is it
so called?</p></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Note.</span>&mdash;"Garish" means dazzling, and by "garish
day" is meant the earlier care-free years when life seemed
all brightness and the author felt perfectly certain of his
ability to take care of himself.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>What at times disturbed his life, even in those "past
years"? What made him hide these fears? What is meant
by saying "Pride ruled my will"? What now is his prayer
concerning these years? Why does he want them put out
of remembrance?</p>

<p>What is the relation of the second stanza to the first one?
It contrasts the author's earlier attitude of mind toward
God with what it is in later years, thus emphasizing the
great change that has taken place in his life.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span></p>

<p>Compare the dependence depicted in the first stanza with
the strength described in the second. In which case is the
man really the stronger? Account for the fact that when
he was strong, but not in his own strength, he really felt
his weakness more than when he was weak.</p></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Note.</span>&mdash;The higher his ideal, the smaller he sees himself;
and the lower his ideal, the larger he sees himself.
Observe also how the prayer to be led "on" reveals the
man's progressive spirit. The unprogressive man would
pray simply for safety and protection.</p>

<div class='center'><br />Stanza III</div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>What lesson does the poet learn from the "past years"?
What confidence does this lesson give him for the future?
What phases of experiences of life are suggested by "moor",
"fen", "crag", and "torrent"?</p></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Note.</span>&mdash;To answer this, there should be an effort to
image a moor, a fen, a crag, or a torrent clearly. Then
when the pupil sees the desolate, lonesome moor; the
miry, almost impassable fen; the sharp, out-jutting crag
which makes the ascent more forbidding and difficult;
and the rushing, unbridged torrent which must be forded
or breasted, even though it threatens destruction; it should
be easy to relate these to the experiences in life which
they typify, or represent.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>How long does the poet believe this guidance will last?
In what words does he say that it will last as long as it will
be needed? What does he mean by "the night"? Beyond
"the night", what vision does he see? Whose are "those
angel faces"?</p>

<p>What is the relation of the third stanza to the second?
It shows how the author's confidence in the Divine guidance<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
to be granted him during future years is strengthened by
the lessons learned in former years.</p></div>

<p>The teacher should again read the poem aloud. This
will impress upon the pupils, not only the truth and
beauty of the poem, but also furnish an ideal to stimulate
them in their preparation for the reading lesson which
is to follow.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII</h2>

<h3>FORM IV</h3>


<h4>JUDAH'S SUPPLICATION TO JOSEPH</h4>

<div class='center'>(Fourth Reader, page 51)</div>

<h3>INTRODUCTION</h3>

<p>Review briefly the Scriptural account of Joseph's life,
and particularly the story of the visits of his brethren
to Egypt to buy corn. Note especially the following
points:</p>

<p>1. The famine in the land of Canaan; the first visit
of Joseph's brothers to Egypt; their interview with
Joseph; the detention of Simeon; Joseph's demand that
Benjamin be brought down.</p>

<p>2. The return to Canaan; Jacob's refusal to let
Benjamin go down into Egypt; Judah's becoming surety
for his safe return.</p>

<p>3. The second visit of Joseph's brethren to Egypt,
this time with Benjamin; their entertainment by Joseph;
their homeward journey; the discovery of the silver cup
in Benjamin's sack; their return to Joseph.</p>

<h3><br />Paragraph IV</h3>

<p>After the selection has been read, the teacher should
proceed by some such method as the following:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>With what does the passage deal? Judah's entreaty to
Joseph for Benjamin's safe return to his father, and the
effect it produced.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span></p>

<p>Into how many parts is the selection naturally divided?
Into three parts, corresponding to the paragraphs as given
in the Reader.</p>

<p>What is the principal idea in each part?</p>

<p>1. Joseph's decision to keep the offender as a bondman.
(Paragraph I)</p>

<p>2. Judah's supplication to Joseph that Benjamin be permitted
to return for his father's sake. (Paragraph
II)</p>

<p>3. Joseph's revelation of his identity, and the provision
he makes for the maintenance of his kindred.
(Paragraph III)</p></div>

<h3><br />DETAILED ANALYSIS</h3>

<div class='center'><br />Paragraph I</div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Why did Joseph's brethren fall "before him on the
ground"? Prostration is the Eastern mode of signifying profound
respect, complete submission.</p>

<p>What is the meaning of "divine"? In this sense, to look
into the future; to see what is hidden from ordinary people.</p>

<p>Does Joseph claim explicitly to have this ability? No, he
merely suggests it, probably to impress them with the idea
of his power.</p>

<p>What does Judah mean by "the iniquity of thy servants"?
Doubtless he has in mind the wrong that they committed
years before, in selling Joseph to the Ishmaelites and deceiving
their father. Verses 21 and 22 of the 42nd chapter of Genesis
go to show that the consciousness of this sin was ever before
them.</p>

<p>What was Judah's attitude toward the accusation brought
against them? He frankly confesses the guilt of all&mdash;not of
Benjamin only.</p>

<p>Why do you think he adopts this attitude, when he must
have been sure that all were guiltless? He perhaps believes
that they are victims of a conspiracy, the object of
which is to place them in the power of this Egyptian governor,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
and he thinks that this submissive attitude is best calculated
to secure mercy at his hands.</p>

<p>How do you account for Joseph's apparent desire to keep
Benjamin in Egypt, with himself? Probably he thinks this
the best means of inducing his father, Jacob, to come to
Egypt. However, he may not really intend to keep Benjamin
at all. He may be making the threat only to test Judah.
It may be remembered that it was Judah who had counselled
the selling of Joseph years before. Joseph may now be trying
to see if Judah is the same kind of man he was when the
selling into Egypt took place&mdash;whether he will sacrifice
Benjamin in this extremity as he sacrificed Joseph himself.</p>

<p>If the latter is Joseph's object, how does the experiment
succeed? It proves that Judah is a different man, that the
years that have elapsed have produced a remarkable change
in his character.</p></div>

<div class='center'><br />Paragraph II</div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Of what does Judah's entreaty largely consist? Of a
recital of the governor's orders and of Jacob's attachment
to Benjamin, the son in whom all the thoughts, hopes, and
desires of his old age are centred.</p>

<p>Upon what does Judah lay the greatest emphasis? Upon
the effect that Benjamin's detention will have upon his father.
Evidently the brothers are very anxious to spare their father
any unnecessary grief and pain.</p>

<p>For what purpose is the whole speech specially adapted?
To stir the emotions. It is suited to appeal to the feelings
of anybody, but, particularly, to the feelings of Egypt's
governor, though his identity is still unknown.</p>

<p>Which are the most pathetic sentences? The two beginning
with, "And we said unto my lord, We have a father,
an old man", and "Now, therefore, when I come to thy
servant, my father, and the lad be not with us".</p>

<p>What features of the speech would make the strongest
appeal to Joseph? The reference to his father's old age and
his attachment to Benjamin; his belief in Joseph's untimely
end; the blow that separation from Benjamin would involve;
Judah's willingness to sacrifice himself.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span></p>

<p>What light does the speech throw upon Judah's character?
It shows a capacity for intense feeling, a deep devotion to his
father, and a spirit of self-sacrifice. It might indicate also
a shrewd knowledge of human nature, for he apparently
knows how to present the case in the most effective manner.</p>

<p>What is the meaning of "thou art even as Pharaoh"?
Thou art as mighty as the king of Egypt.</p>

<p>Explain "thy servant became surety for the lad unto my
father". Judah had given Jacob a guarantee that Benjamin
should return safely.</p>

<p>Select any figurative expression and give its meaning.
"Thy servants shall bring down the gray hairs of thy servant
our father with sorrow to the grave." The blow which
separation from Benjamin would involve will cause the aged
father to die of a broken heart.</p>

<p>What are the main characteristics of the supplication?
The language is simple and direct, the feeling is of the loftiest
character, and the whole speech is highly eloquent. If the
test of true eloquence is the intensity of the appeal it makes
to worthy emotions, this passage may well be regarded as
one of the most eloquent in all literature.</p></div>

<div class='center'><br />Paragraph III</div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Did Joseph purposely select this as the most fitting moment
to reveal himself? No. He revealed himself because he
could not help it and because Judah's appeal had so worked
upon his feelings. The first sentence of the paragraph indicates
this.</p>

<p>Why did he send every man away except his brothers?
He did not wish others to see his own lack of self-control or
his brothers' shame and embarrassment. Moreover, it was
a solemn situation, too sacred for vulgar eyes to gaze upon.</p>

<p>We are told that he "wept aloud", that "he fell upon
his brother Benjamin's neck, and wept", that "he kissed all
his brethren", etc. Is he unduly demonstrative? Eastern
people are much more emotional and demonstrative than
Western people.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span></p>

<p>Why did he have to repeat his assurance that he was
Joseph? The first announcement was so amazing that it
seemed incredible to them. Moreover, all his previous communications
had been through an interpreter and, no doubt,
their amazement was increased by hearing him address them
in their own tongue.</p>

<p>Upon what ground did Joseph tell his brothers that they
should not blame themselves for selling him into Egypt?
Upon the ground that God had brought good out of the evil
they had done.</p>

<p>Is he quite right in telling them that they should not be
grieved for the wrong they did him? They were free agents;
God did not will that they should sin, though He brought
good out of it. From this point of view Joseph is wrong.
But he doubtless sees that his brothers have long ago repented
their action and does not wish them to continue to
blame themselves. His assurance is no doubt prompted by
a noble generosity induced, to some extent, by Judah's appeal.</p>

<p>What seems to be Joseph's dominating motive? His love
for his father. His repeated references to him show this.</p>

<p>We can understand his desire to provide for his father
and Benjamin, but why for his brothers who had wronged
him? Partly for his father's sake, perhaps. It was natural,
in those patriarchal days, that Jacob, if he migrated to
Egypt, should wish his family to do the same. Besides,
Joseph sees that his brothers are changed men.</p>

<p>What inducements does he hold out to them? He shows
them that his own power in Egypt is sufficient to protect
them; he promises them the fertile land of Goshen, with
sufficient food for themselves and their flocks and herds; and
he points out that five years of famine are yet to be in the
land, and that they must inevitably suffer if the invitation
is rejected.</p>

<p>Joseph frequently draws attention to his power in Egypt.
Is he at all vain-glorious? No, he does this to assure his
brothers that the wrong done him years before has had,
through the goodness of God, a beneficent result; to show
them that it has not been all suffering in his long exile;
and to induce his father to come down to Egypt.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span></p>

<p>"After that his brethren talked with him." About what
would they probably talk? No doubt Joseph would ask many
things about what had occurred in Canaan since he left, and
would give his brothers an account of his own experiences in
Egypt.</p>

<p>Does it not seem strange that Joseph, during all these
years, should never have taken measures to find out how his
kindred fared, or to assure them that he was still alive? He
was probably ever looking forward to such a situation as this,
confident that the dreams of his boyhood would still be
realized. It was, perhaps, this belief in the ultimate fulfilment
of his dreams that had kept him silent during these
years.</p>

<p>What qualities of character does Joseph show in his
speech? A spirit of noble generosity and forgiveness, filial
devotion, and a desire to find good in the midst of seeming
evil.</p>

<p>Point out passages that indicate these qualities. What
admirable characteristics does the whole selection exhibit?
Simplicity, directness, and eloquence of language, noble
emotion, loftiness of character, and high ideals.</p></div>

<p>As a final synthesis of the lesson, let the pupils tell
the story in their own words, preserving, as far as possible,
the same order of ideas as is followed in the extract.
This will reveal to the teacher whether they have grasped
the ideas in their proper relationship.</p>


<h4><br />MERCY</h4>

<div class='center'>(Fourth Reader, page 89)</div>

<h4>THE SETTING OF THE SELECTION</h4>

<p>This selection is taken from Shakespeare's play <i>The
Merchant of Venice</i>, iv. i. In this play, Shylock, a Jew
of Venice, had loaned Antonio three thousand ducats, repayable
on a certain date without interest, but if not so
paid, Antonio was to forfeit a pound of flesh from such<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
part of his body as pleased the Jew. Antonio, not being
able to pay the money as agreed, Shylock sued for the fulfilment
of the bond, and in court refused to accept even
three times the amount borrowed, insisting on a pound
of the merchant's flesh. According to the law, there
appeared to be no help for Antonio, but the judge, Portia,
asked Shylock to show mercy. To this he answered, "On
what compulsion must I? Tell me that." This selection
is part of Portia's reply to Shylock's question. The
teacher should relate to the pupils the outline given above.</p>

<h3><br />ANALYSIS OF THE THOUGHT</h3>

<div class='hang1'>1. The qualities of mercy:</div>

<div class='hang2'>
(1) It is not forced.<br /></div>
<div class='hang2'>(2) It is gentle.<br /></div>
<div class='hang2'>(3) It carries a twofold blessing.<br /></div>
<div class='hang2'>(4) It is the most powerful attribute in men of might.<br /></div>
<div class='hang2'>(5) It is divine in its nature.<br />
</div>

<div class='hang1'>2. Where mercy is found:</div>

<div class='hang2'>
(1) It is found "enthroned in the hearts of kings".<br /></div>
<div class='hang2'>(2) It is found as a Divine attribute.<br />
</div>

<div class='hang1'>3. The results of showing mercy:</div>

<div class='hang2'>
(1) It adds strength to strength.<br /></div>
<div class='hang2'>(2) It makes man God-like.<br />
</div>

<div class='blockquot'><p>Question, in order to develop the analysis of the thought,
and write on the board the topics, as given by the pupils.</p></div>

<h3><br />THE DIFFICULTIES</h3>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Quality of mercy. The nature of mercy is not strained,
is not forced. When the Jew asks "Upon what compulsion
must I?", Portia answers that compulsion has nothing to do
with mercy. It is not in the nature of mercy to be a result
of compulsion.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span></p>

<p>Mightiest in the mightiest. This is capable of a double
interpretation&mdash;(1) the quality of mercy in a man of great
power must be strong in proportion as his power is great.
(2) Mercy is at its greatest when exhibited by the greatest.
Portia would wish to convey the first meaning, as that would
have the more weight with Shylock.</p>

<p>Becomes the thron&egrave;d monarch. The possession of this
quality makes a man more truly kingly than the mere wearing
of a crown.</p>

<p>Sceptre. The symbol of the monarch's authority.</p>

<p>Temporal power. Power which belongs to this world only.</p>

<p>Mercy&mdash;is enthron&egrave;d in the hearts of kings. The "hearts
of kings" are for mercy what the throne itself is for a king&mdash;the
most exalted position he can occupy.</p>

<p>Mercy seasons justice. Mercy tempers justice, rendering
it less severe and making it more acceptable and pleasing.</p>

<p>Develop the meaning through Illustration, when possible.
For example, to teach the meaning of "seasons" in "mercy
seasons justice", lead the pupils to use the word seasons in
such sentences as: We season our food with spices. Lead,
from the meaning in common or familiar use, to its use in
the lesson. Avoid mere dictionary meanings of words. Teach
the use of the word where it is found, never one of its
meanings apart from its use.</p></div>

<h3><br />THE ARGUMENT</h3>

<div class="blockquot"><p>There is no compulsion in mercy. Its course is always
from the higher to the lower. It is a blessing to both giver
and receiver. The greater the mercy shown, the greater will
be the giver. To show mercy does more to make a monarch
kingly than does his crown. The one stands for the exercise
of authority and power commanding obedience and awe; the
other comes from the heart and reveals the character. It is
more than kingly, it is God-like; for in exercising it, man's
power becomes more like God's than in any other way.</p>

<p>Develop the above argument by questioning. Sum up the
result by requiring the whole argument to be given by a pupil
orally in his own language. Finally, require the pupils to
write, as forcibly as they can, the whole of Portia's argument.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span></p>

<p>The remainder of Portia's speech as given in the play may
also be given to the pupils. In that case, the remainder of
the argument should be given as follows:</p>

<p>You demand justice, Jew. Even so, require it as you hope
Heaven may require it of you. Consider that mercy is necessary
to salvation, and remember that, as we all pray for
mercy, that fact itself requires us all to show the deeds of
mercy.</p>

<p>The speech containing this part of the argument is as
follows:</p>

<div class='poem2'>
Therefore, Jew,<br />
Though justice be thy plea, consider this,<br />
That, in the course of justice, none of us<br />
Should see salvation: We do pray for mercy;<br />
And that same prayer doth teach us all to render<br />
The deeds of mercy.<br />
</div>

<p>"We do pray for mercy", refers to the general prayer of
humanity for mercy. To have limited its reference to the
petition for mercy in the Lord's Prayer would have weakened
its force to the Jew.</p></div>


<h4><br />MORNING ON THE LI&Egrave;VRE</h4>

<div class='center'>(Fourth Reader, page 228)</div>

<h3>ASSIGNMENT</h3>

<p>1. The teacher should explain to the pupils that the
Li&egrave;vre River (pronounced Lee-eh-vr) runs through a deep
gorge in the height of land on the Quebec side of the
Ottawa River, into which it flows not far from the
Capital. In some places, the banks of the Li&egrave;vre rise
abruptly to a great height; at others more gradually, the
slope being covered with a thick forest growth. As the
river nears the Ottawa, the banks become much lower.
The scenery, whether viewed from the height above or
from the river below, is very beautiful.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span></p>

<p>2. The teacher should ask a few questions which can
be answered easily from the pupil's own reading of the
poem, for example:</p>

<p>From what position does the author first view the
scene? What things in the scene appeal to each of the
pupils as the most beautiful? Describe the incident mentioned
in the last stanza. State in a single sentence the
subject-matter of the whole poem.</p>


<h3><br />TREATMENT</h3>

<p>The pupils' answers to the questions given when the
lesson was assigned should be dealt with first.</p>

<div class='center'><br />Stanza I</div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>What first attracts the author's attention as he looks upward?
What makes us feel how high up the banks the mist
extends? What part of the mist appears most beautiful?
Why? To what is it compared? How does this comparison
affect our impression of (1) the colour of the mist; (2) the
height of the mist? Does the comparison make the meaning
clearer? Is the comparison apt? Is it beautiful?</p></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Note.</span>&mdash;When a blacksmith cools the red-hot iron in
a tub of water, vapour rises to the roof of his shop. The
blaze from his forge shining on this mist produces the
colours mentioned. The amethyst is a precious stone,
clear and translucent, with a colour inclining to purple.
The presence of coal dust or smoke in the vapour would
help to produce the colour of amethyst. The same effect
would result, if some smoke or dust were mingled with
the mist where the sun's rays reach it at the top of the
gorge.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Screams his matins to the day." What is meant? What
idea does the author wish to convey by this mention of the
bird? Out of hearing "of the clang of his hammer" gives<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
a strong impression of the great height of the gorge. Of
what "giant" are we made to think? What is meant by
"skirts of mist"?</p></div>

<p>The teacher's reading of this stanza, a part at a time,
if it is taken up in that way, or all at once, should aid
much in impressing upon the minds of the pupils the
wonderful beauty of the scene described, and this is the
main purpose of the lesson.</p>

<div class='center'><br />Stanza II</div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The author is paddling down the river. Describe the
movement. What shows that the mist has risen from the
surface of the water? What indicates the calmness of the
river? What things connected with himself does the author
show to be in harmony with the scene? How does he indicate
the harmony in each of the following: The motion of his
canoe, the surface of the water, his own activity, the force
of gravity, the character of the morning, and the forest life?
We should expect him to dip his paddle very quietly, if he
felt the calmness of the morning, but to show that the
"silence" pervades all nature, the very drops of water from
the paddle blades seem to fall gently, in sympathy with the
spirit of silence reigning all around. What are the "river
reaches"? The reach is the stretch of the river between two
bends. How are they "borne in a mirror"? The high cliff-like
banks are mirrored in the surface of the water. Explain
the colour "purple gray". It is the colour of the image of
the banks in the water. What is meant by "sheer away"?
It means that the "river reaches" curve away like a winding
road. Try to see the picture of the winding river, apparently
growing smaller as it passes curve after curve. As it seems
to recede into the distance, the surface of the river forms
a "misty line of light", just before it melts into the shadows
of the forest. Where do the forest and the stream seem to
meet? What does the word "plight" suggest about their
meeting? What suggests a meeting-place out of sight? Why
is the meeting represented as taking place in the shadow?
Now what is described in the second stanza?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span></p>

<p>"As a cloud", "like a dream". Do these make the
meaning clearer? Explain. Are these comparisons apt?
Show the fitness of "silvery", "crystal deep", "asleep".</p></div>


<div class='center'><br />Stanza III</div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>As the author goes farther and farther down the stream,
the river runs more slowly. How is this shown? What shows
that the little creek runs very slowly into the river? How
does the author say the creek is winding? Why would not
the same word "curling" do to show that the river was
winding through the gorge? What are we told about the
mouth of the creek? See those sunken wrecks down in the
water. What are they like? What shows you that they are
very large tree trunks? What starts the ducks? See them
as they rise out of the water. Make a drawing to show their
position. The drawing should show them flying in the shape
of a horizontal letter V, as wild ducks fly. What words show
you that they keep this position unbroken? Hear them as
they fly off at their utmost speed. Why such haste? What
makes the "swivelling whistle"? This is the noise they
make as they fly. Imagine a whistle to be set whirling around
as it whistles. The change in the sound due to the whirling
motion of the whistle might be called a swivelling whistle.
See them go, led through the shadow. Hear them, as they
disappear behind a rocky point ahead. What is meant by
their "whirr"? What has made us forget all about the beauty
of the silent morning? What effect did this silence probably
have on the poet's judgment of the noise made by the ducks?
Now what is described in the third stanza?</p>

<p>Consider the fitness of the words "lazy", "sucks",
"bleeds", "sneak", "swept", "splashy".</p></div>


<h3><br />SYNTHESIS OF THE WHOLE BY CORRELATING
THE LESSON WITH ART</h3>

<div class="blockquot"><p>1. Make a sketch of the scene in the first stanza, showing
the rocky, high, forest-covered banks, with mist rising along
the slopes, and the man in a canoe on a small stream below.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span></p>

<p>2. Make a sketch of the scene described in the second
stanza, showing the winding river, with its high banks
appearing to meet in the distance, the man in his canoe
in the foreground, and over all the dim light of early morning.</p>

<p>3. Make a sketch of the ducks rising from the water.
Show the reeds at the mouth of the creek and the rocky spur
toward which the birds are heading.</p></div>

<h3><br />THE LIFE OF THE AUTHOR</h3>

<div class="blockquot"><p>As it is not necessary to know anything about the author
to fully understand this poem, nothing should be said about
his life until the pupils become interested in him through
their interest in what he has written. Then teach the main
points in his life. See sketch of his life, at the back of the
Manual on <i>The Ontario Readers</i>.</p></div>


<h4><br />DICKENS IN THE CAMP</h4>

<div class='center'>(Fourth Reader, page 287)</div>

<h3>INTRODUCTION</h3>

<p>By way of introduction, it might be well to tell the
pupils something of Bret Harte&mdash;his residence in California,
his experience as a prospector in the goldfields, his
stories of the mining camps, and his admiration of
Dickens. (See Manual on <i>The Ontario Readers</i>, p. 315.)
These facts throw considerable light upon the poem, and
will be useful in aiding the pupils to interpret it properly.
This poem was written shortly after the death of Dickens.
It might well follow the study of <i>David Copperfield's First
Journey Alone</i> and <i>The Indignation of Nicholas Nickleby</i>.</p>

<h3><br />PREPARATION</h3>

<p>When the poem has been read, the teacher should, before
beginning the analysis, ask a few general questions,
such as:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>What has Dickens to do with the story related in the
poem? He was the author of the book read in the camp, <i>Old
Curiosity Shop</i>, of which "Nell" is the heroine. (A brief
outline of the story, with special reference to the feelings it
arouses in the reader, might be given here.)</p>

<p>What kind of camp is referred to in the poem? A mining
camp. The last line of the second stanza suggests this.</p>

<p>Where is the scene laid? Apparently in California, among
the Sierra Nevada Mountains. This is indicated in the first
stanza.</p>

<p>What is the leading idea of the poem? The effect which
the reading of a story by Dickens produced in a Western
mining camp.</p>

<p>What are the main sub-topics?</p>

<div class='poem2'>
1. The scene of the incident. Stanzas I-III.<br />
2. The reading of the story. Stanzas IV-VII.<br />
3. A lament for the death of Dickens. Stanzas VIII-X.<br />
</div></div>

<h3><br />MINUTE ANALYSIS</h3>


<div class='center'><br />Stanza I</div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>How does the description of the scene, as given in stanza I,
differ from that given in stanza II? Stanza I gives the background
and the remote surroundings, while stanza II places
us in the midst of the camp.</p>

<p>What features give the story a romantic setting? The
stately "pines", the singing "river", the "slowly drifting
moon", the snow-capped mountains.</p>

<p>From the description in the first stanza, give as clear a
picture of the location of the camp as possible. It was
situated on the edge of a ca&ntilde;on in the Sierras, towering pines
rising round about, the river flowing noisily beneath, and
the mountains uplifting their snow-covered peaks in the
distance.</p>

<p>Explain the comparison suggested in the last two lines.
The mountain summits, with their everlasting snows, resemble
in the distance the minarets, or lofty tapering towers,
attached to Mohammedan mosques.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span></p>

<p>Which is preferable, "minarets of snow", or "snow-covered
peaks"? The former, because it is a more unusual
expression and because of what it suggests.</p></div>


<div class='center'><br />Stanza II</div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Why is the camp-fire represented as a rude humorist? It
causes faces and forms that are haggard and care-worn to
appear fresh and healthy, thus playing a grim jest upon those
gathered round it.</p>

<p>Explain the significance of "fierce" in the last line. In
the mad rush for gold, all the worst elements of man's nature
are brought to the surface&mdash;disregard for the rights of others,
contempt for law and order, and even carelessness with regard
to human life.</p>

<p>Consider the fitness of the words "rude", "painted",
"race", as used here.</p></div>


<div class='center'><br />Stanza III</div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>What indicates the value that the owner places upon this
book? The words "treasure" and "hoarded" suggest that
it is one of his most highly prized possessions.</p>

<p>What suggests that this is not the first time the story has
been read in camp? The word "anew".</p>

<p>How does the poet indicate the absorbing interest that
the story has for these men? He says the fascination is so
great as to draw the attention of these rough miners even
from their card-playing. Explain "listless leisure".</p></div>


<div class='center'><br />Stanza IV</div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Explain "the firelight fell". The fire gradually died down,
because, absorbed in their interest in the story, the miners
forgot to put on fresh fuel.</p>

<p>Why is Dickens called the "Master"? A master is one
who attains the highest degree of skill in some art. Dickens
was master of the art of story-telling, a master of vivid
narration, a master of pathos and humour.</p></div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span></p>

<div class='center'><br />Stanzas V and VI</div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Is there anything in these stanzas which might throw
light upon the identity of the reader? He is probably the
poet himself. His familiarity with the fancies of the reader
seem to indicate this. Besides, the reader is kept very much
in the background&mdash;we are told only that he was young&mdash;and
this seems to be in keeping with the modesty of the poet
as shown elsewhere in the poem. At any rate, we must
admit that the reader was a poet, for he indulges in fancies
of a highly poetical nature.</p>

<p>What are those fancies? Such is the absorbing interest
of the story that even the pines and cedars seem to stand
silent to listen, and the fir trees gather closer in order that
nothing may escape their hearing.</p>

<p>What is the poetic element in these fancies? Ascribing
to inanimate objects the power of human interest and
sympathy.</p>

<p>What effect does the poet secure by picturing the trees as
listeners? It enhances our idea of the absorbing interest of
the story.</p>

<p>Mention any other illustrations of a poet's use of this
device of attributing human sympathies to inanimate objects.
Many might be given, for example:</p>

<p>Byron's <i>Waterloo:</i></p>

<div class='poem2'>
And Ardennes waves above them her green leaves,<br />
Dewy with Nature's tear-drops, as they pass,<br />
Grieving, if aught inanimate e'er grieves,<br />
Over the unreturning brave.<br />
</div>

<p>Longfellow's <i>Evangeline</i> describing the song of the
mocking-bird:</p>

<div class='poem3'>
Shook from his little throat such floods of delirious music,<br />
That the whole air and the woods and waves seemed silent to listen.<br />
</div>

<p>Mrs. Hemans' <i>The Landing of the Pilgrim Fathers:</i></p>

<div class='poem2'>
Amidst the storm they sang, and the stars heard, and the sea.<br /></div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span></p>

<p>What experience of "Nell" is alluded to in the last two
lines of stanza V? She and her grandfather had been lost on
their journey from London.</p>

<p>Why does the poet say that the whole camp "lost their
way" with "Nell" on English meadows? The narrative was
so vivid that the miners, in spirit, accompanied her in her
wanderings.</p></div>


<div class='center'><br />Stanza VII</div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>What is meant by "Their cares dropped from them"?
They forgot themselves, their cares and privations, and
realized the hopes and fears, the joys and sorrows of "Little
Nell".</p>

<p>How was this result brought about? It was due to the
fascination of the story.</p>

<p>To what does the poet compare this? To some "spell
divine", some supernatural influence, which causes their own
troubles to disappear for the time being.</p>

<p>Give, then, the meaning of "o'ertaken as by some spell
divine". They are brought, as it were, under the influence
of some magician, who, by the exercise of his power, transports
them from their own world to that in which "Nell"
lives and moves.</p>

<p>Show the beauty of the comparison in the last two lines
of this stanza. As the needles of the pine, through the action
of the wind, fall silently and almost unperceived, so the
cares of the miners were forgotten in the all-compelling interest
of the story.</p>

<p>Compare Longfellow:</p>

<div class='poem'>
The cares that infest the day<br />
Shall fold their tents like the Arabs,<br />
And as silently steal away.<br />
</div>

<p>Why is this comparison more appropriate than, for example,
like the leaves from the trees in autumn, or, like snow-flakes
from the clouds in winter? Because it is drawn from
the objects at hand, not from more remote things&mdash;an example
of local colour.</p>

<p>Explain "gusty pine". A pine exposed to the mountain
blasts.</p></div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span></p>


<div class='center'><br />Stanza VIII</div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Who is referred to by "he" in the second line? Dickens&mdash;not
the reader of the story.</p>

<p>What is meant by "wrought that spell"? Produced that
magic influence.</p>

<p>State the question in full. Is "he who wrought that spell"
lost, too?</p>

<p>What tale has the "towering pine" to tell? That the
mining camp has disappeared.</p>

<p>And what the "stately Kentish spire"? That Dickens has
gone. (Dickens' home was at Gadshill, in Kent.)</p>

<p>What is the one tale that both have to tell? A tale of
disappearance and death.</p>

<p>Is the question asked in the second line answered? Not
directly, though the answer is implied.</p>

<p>State the substantial meaning of the stanza. The
"towering pine" of the Sierras tells of the disappearance of
the mining camp; the "stately spire" of Kent tells of the
death of Dickens; both bear witness to the potent influence
of Dickens.</p></div>

<div class='center'><br />Stanza IX</div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>What is the "fragrant story" of the Western mining
camp? The tribute that the incident related in the poem
pays to the magical power of Dickens as a story writer.</p>

<p>Why is it called a "fragrant story"? The author poetically
conceives of it as being laden with the fragrance of the
fir, the pine, and the cedar&mdash;a sort of "incense" to the
memory of the "Master".</p>

<p>What is incense? The odours of spices and gums burned
in religious rites.</p>

<p>What poetic idea does the author express in the last two
lines? The hopvines of Kent are represented as uniting with
the pine, fir, and cedar in sending forth their fragrance as
incense.</p>

<p>What is the meaning, then, of the whole stanza? Let the
fragrance of the pine, the cedar, and the fir, mingled with
the odours of the Kentish hopvines, be as incense to the
memory of the "Master".</p></div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span></p>


<div class='center'><br />Stanza X</div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Does the poet mean that the grave of Dickens is literally
adorned with oak, holly, and laurel wreaths? No; he is
speaking figuratively.</p>

<p>What do these typify? The tributes of admiration, reverence,
and love that are paid to the memory of Dickens in
his own country.</p>

<p>Of what is each emblematic? The oak is emblematic of
England, the life of whose people he so vividly depicted; the
holly suggests his charming Christmas stories; the laurel
signifies his mastery of the art of writing.</p>

<p>What does the poet mean by "This spray of Western
pine"? This poem was written in the Western World, as a
tribute to the memory of the great novelist.</p>

<p>What personal characteristic does the poet show in the
third line? A sense of humility, which leads him to suggest
that this poem is unworthy of a place among the tributes
paid to the name and fame of the great artist.</p>

<p>Stripped of its figurative significance, what is the meaning
of the whole stanza? To the many tokens of love and admiration
that are offered to the memory of Dickens, may I be
permitted to add this poem&mdash;a Western tribute to the worldwide
influence of the famous author.</p></div>

<h3><br />RECONSTRUCTION</h3>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Tell the story of the poem in your own words.</p>

<p>In a ca&ntilde;on of the Sierras, a group of rough miners were
gathered about a camp-fire. Around them stood the stately
pines, above which the moon was slowly rising; below, at the
bottom of the ca&ntilde;on, a river sang, as it threaded its way
among the boulders; and, far in the distance, the mountains
reared their snow-covered summits to the evening sky. The
flickering camp-fire played strange tricks upon those gathered
round it, for it gave to the care-worn faces and bent forms of
the miners the appearance of freshness and health.</p>

<p>One of the miners, a mere youth, opened his pack, drew
therefrom a copy of Dickens' <i>Old Curiosity Shop</i>, and began<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
to read aloud. At once, all other occupations were suspended,
and everybody drew near to listen to the story. The whole
camp yielded itself to the fascination of the tale, and in its
absorbing interest they forgot themselves and their surroundings,
their ills, their hardships, and their cares. One
might almost fancy that the very pines and cedars became
silent, and that the fir trees drew closer to hear the story of
"Little Nell".</p>

<p>Dickens, the "Master", has gone, but, among the many
tributes that are paid to his power as a writer, let this little
tale of the Western camp be added, to illustrate the universal
nature of his influence.</p></div>


<h4><br />DOST THOU LOOK BACK ON WHAT HATH BEEN</h4>

<div class='center'>(Fourth Reader, page 289)</div>

<h3>PREPARATION</h3>

<p>This lesson should be preceded by a suitable preparatory
lesson on the life of some man, for example, Peel,
Disraeli, or Lincoln, who, in spite of all obstacles, rose to
eminence in the nation and lived "To mould a mighty
state's decrees".</p>

<h3><br />INTRODUCTION</h3>

<p>Tennyson and Arthur Hallam, as young men at
college, were great friends. The bond of affection between
them was probably as strong as it was possible for friendship
between two men to be. When Hallam died in 1833,
at twenty-two years of age, Tennyson said of him: "He
was as near perfection as a mortal man could be". From
time to time during the next seventeen years, Tennyson
wrote short poems on themes which occurred to him in
connection with his thoughts of Hallam. These he finally
collected and published in one volume, called <i>In Memoriam</i>.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span></p>


<h3><br />PURPOSE</h3>

<p>The purpose of this lesson should be in harmony with
the purpose of <i>In Memoriam</i>. It should, therefore, be a
study of life within the comprehension of the pupils. The
lesson should aid in securing the development of character
and an appreciation of worthy ambition and enduring
friendship.</p>

<h3><br />ASSIGNMENT</h3>

<p>The lesson should be assigned in such a way as to
encourage the pupils' natural desire to learn something
through their own efforts. A few questions should be
given to be answered from their own study, for example:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>1. What does the first line show regarding Tennyson's
present thought of Hallam?</p>

<p>2. What stanzas describe the progress of the man who reminds
him of Hallam?</p>

<p>3. What is described in the remaining stanzas?</p>

<p>4. What lines suggest something about this man's feelings
toward the scenes and friends of his youth?</p>

<p>5. In what respect, according to the last stanza, does
Tennyson show that one of these old-time friends is
like himself?</p></div>


<h3><br />CLASS WORK</h3>

<div class="blockquot"><p>What does Tennyson describe in the first four stanzas?</p></div>


<div class='center'><br />Stanza I</div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Why does he call the man "divinely gifted"? Because
he has had great natural gifts.</p>

<p>When should we call a man of only ordinary ability
"divinely gifted"? What have you read that illustrates this?
(If the pupils cannot answer this question, the teacher should
tell briefly the parable of the talents.)<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span></p>

<p>What is meant by "Whose life in low estate began"?
Why are the details about his early life mentioned? State
briefly the thought contained in this stanza.</p></div>

<div class='center'><br />Stanza II</div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>What was the effect of his humble birth on his progress
in early life? In what ways did it act as a bar: (1) upon
his own mind; (2) upon the good-will of others toward himself?
Which of these two do the following lines from <i>&OElig;none</i>
indicate that the poet would say must be overcome first?</p>

<div class='poem2'>
Self-reverence, self-knowledge, self-control,<br />
These three alone lead life to sovereign power.<br />
</div>

<p>State in your own words, the full meaning of "breaks his
birth's invidious bar". <span class="smcap">Note.</span>&mdash;"Invidious" means likely to
incur, or bring on envy, ill-will, or hatred.</p>

<p>What idea is suggested in the second line as to the opportunities
which come to such a man? Imagine him grasping
these fleeting chances. What were his probable feelings
toward those things which eluded his grasp? (Be careful in
answering this. Remember that the man has gained the
mastery of himself.)</p>

<p>What is meant by "blows of circumstance"? What were
some of these difficulties?</p>

<p>What does the action-word "breasts" suggest: (1) about
the character of these difficulties, (2) about the character
of the man? Explain "grapples with his evil star". What
is the allusion? Tell, in the poet's own words, what this
"evil star" was. Imagine this man grappling with it. What
term do boys often use for a similar action? Which is going
to win this wrestling match? Give reasons, from what the
man has already done, for thinking that he will win. What
does this action show about his belief in luck?</p>

<p>What do the action-words in this stanza suggest about
the man's character? What sounds in each of the words help
to emphasize this grim determination?</p>

<p>State briefly the relation of the thought of this stanza to
that of the first.</p></div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span></p>


<div class='center'><br />Stanza III</div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>What effect did the man's early struggles have on his
mental power and character? What does Tennyson call this
increased energy and strength of character? He calls it
"force". Now, explain "makes by force his merit known".</p>

<p>What position in the gift of the nation do the next three
lines show that he gained at last? What words indicate the
emblem of the Premier's power?</p>

<p>"Clutch the golden keys." What does this action suggest
as to his character? What word is generally used to denote
such determination to gain power and influence? What
makes such ambition lawful? What use does Tennyson show
this man made of his ambition? What is meant by "mould
a mighty state's decrees"? As Premier, to whom would it
be his duty to give advice?</p>

<p>The people know that the sovereign must act on the
advice of his ministers, of whom the Premier is the most influential;
but they believe that the judgment of the sovereign
often modifies and improves this advice. To the nation, this
influence of the sovereign is a silent force, but, like the silent
forces in nature, they believe it to be powerful.</p>

<p>In what words does Tennyson express this mutual influence
of the King and the Premier? What features of this influence
are expressed respectively by the words "shape" and
"whisper"? What action-words in this stanza suggest the
relation (1) of effort, (2) of time, to the magnitude of the
work?</p>

<p>State in a single sentence the thought of this stanza.</p></div>

<div class='center'><br />Stanza IV</div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>What is the final test of the value of a law? Its effects
on the people. In what words does Tennyson show the effect
on the people of the laws made through this man's influence?</p>

<p>Explain how this man became "The pillar of a people's
hope". What words show the far-reaching extent of his influence?
Which shows the more force in the man, his influence
with the King or his later influence in the whole<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
nation? In what words does Tennyson show which he thinks
the greater? To which do "high" and "higher" respectively
refer? What does "Fortune's crowning slope" suggest about
(1) the honour which the man has now gained, (2) the nature
of the road he has travelled?</p></div>

<div class='center'><br />Stanza V</div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Picture the man as he looks back after having reached
the height of his ambition. Describe his mood. At what
times does he indulge in these dreamy memories? What
does he seem to see in these quiet hours? What hill and
stream does the poet mean? What feeling does each awaken?
Why is the "sweetness" called "secret"? Why is the
"dearness" called "distant"?</p></div>

<div class='center'><br />Stanza VI</div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>What part of his life is meant by "his narrower fate"?
With what is he comparing that early life, when he calls it
"his narrower fate"? Using similar language, what might
his present position of great influence be called?</p>

<p>Some think that the first line of this stanza refers to the
limitations or restrictions of his early life, while others say
the poet was thinking simply of the stream, as the limit or
boundary of the things that influenced his childhood. Which
view is to be preferred? Which meaning agrees with the use
of the word "its" in the next line? Would this man now
look back on those difficulties of his early life as limitations
and hindrances, or as things which helped to make him what
he is?</p>

<p>Now explain "The limit of his narrower fate". Compare
the direction in which he looks in his day dreams now, with
the direction in which he looked in those of his boyhood.
What is meant by "vocal springs"?</p>

<p>In what way were the games of his youth prophetic of his
future work as a man? What do people mean by saying,
"The boy is father of the man"?</p></div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span></p>


<div class='center'><br />Stanza VII</div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Describe the present occupation of the friend of his boyhood.
What information about his friend does the word
"native" give us? What phrases show how he does his work?</p>

<p>Compare the farmer's query in the last line with that in
the first line of the poem.</p></div>

<h3><br />SYNOPSIS OF DETAILS</h3>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Under the following heads, point out the resemblance of
Hallam to the statesman and of Tennyson to the farmer:</p></div>

<div class='poem'>
1. Early friendship<br />
2. Their separation<br />
3. Progress since parting<br />
4. Memories of each other.<br />
</div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>It is hoped that no teacher will use these questions as
a substitute for his own questioning. If they are accepted
as suggestive in regard to both interpretation and method,
they may be of real service, otherwise they will be almost
valueless.</p></div>


<h4><br />WATERLOO</h4>

<div class='center'>(Fourth Reader, page 311)</div>

<h3>AIM</h3>

<p>To lead the pupils to appreciate the music and imagery
of the poem.</p>

<h3><br />PREPARATION</h3>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Where is Waterloo situated? In Belgium. What two
armies were engaged in this battle? The French and the
English; with the latter were some Prussian allies. Who
were the French and the English commanders? Napoleon
and Wellington. What was the result of the battle? The
overthrow of Napoleon and his banishment to St. Helena.
What would have been the consequence if Wellington had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
been defeated? Napoleon would possibly have had complete
mastery of Europe. Picture this struggle of great commanders
and disciplined armies, while Europe waited breathlessly
for the outcome. (The pupils should read some good
history of this battle.)</p></div>


<h3><br />PRESENTATION</h3>

<p>Read the poem to the pupils in such a way as to make
vivid the scenes depicted.</p>


<h3><br />DEVELOPMENT</h3>

<p>What has the poet described in this poem? Some of the
events preceding the battle.</p>

<p>What are the main pictures found in each stanza? (Write
on the black-board.)</p>

<p>1. The ball</p>

<p>2. The sound of the enemy's cannon</p>

<p>3. The Duke of Brunswick</p>

<p>4. The farewells</p>

<p>5. The muster</p>

<p>6. The gathering of the Highlanders</p>

<p>7. The march to battle</p>

<p>8. Summary of pictures and the result.</p>

<p>Do you see any stanza that interferes with the progress
of the action? The third stanza anticipates the battle and
destroys the continuity between the sounds of the approaching
enemy and the hurried farewells.</p>

<p>Why does the poet devote a special stanza to the Highlanders?
Were they more worthy of mention than the
English and Irish regiments? The author, George Gordon,
Lord Byron, belonged to a Scotch family. The muster of the
Highlanders at midnight, combined with their stirring music,
made a very picturesque incident.</p>

<p>Consider the elements which contribute to the various
scenes:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span></p>


<div class='center'><br />Stanza I</div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>What is described? The ball given by the Duchess of
Richmond. What is the emotion of this stanza? Pleasure,
gaiety. What is the picture in the first line? The arrival
of the guests, the welcomes, and the "revelry" of the
assembly. Why does the author say "Belgium's capital"
rather than "Brussels"? It suggests the capital of a nation
with a noble people. Who were the "Beauty" and the
"Chivalry"? The ladies, the officers of the army, and the
nobility. Describe the picture you see in "bright the lamps
shone o'er fair women and brave men". The large ball-room,
the brilliantly lighted chandeliers, the beautiful costumes of
the ladies, the uniforms and decorations of officers and nobles.
Describe the images that are suggested by "and when music
arose with its voluptuous swell". The bands of the regiments
are playing the music of the dance. Notice how the
poet changes the rhythm to the foot of three syllables, to
indicate the music of the waltz. What contrast do you find
in the last two lines? "Marriage bell" and "rising knell".
What was the purpose of this? To show the contrast between
pleasure and fear.</p></div>

<div class='center'><br />Stanza II</div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>What is the theme? The sound of the enemy's cannon.
Why does the author use the dramatic form? A conversation
between two people of opposite temperaments gives
greater reality to the picture. The first seems to expect
danger, but is, for a moment, silenced by the other's upbraiding
him for attempting to spoil the pleasure of the
evening. A repetition of the "heavy sound" proves that he
is right. The second is a lover of pleasure, who would not
have the first speaker alarm the guests by his gloomy anticipations.
Show how the second speaker indicates his impatience.
His answers are short, he speaks in ellipses. "On
with the dance", and "No sleep till morn". Notice the
positive tone of the first speaker in the repetition, "It is&mdash;it
is".</p></div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span></p>


<div class='center'><br />Stanza III</div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>What is described here? The fate of Brunswick? Why
does the author single out Brunswick from all the others
who died? One specific case appeals to the reader more
effectually than the report of the death of unknown thousands.
Brunswick's father had been a noted general in the
war with Napoleon. Explain, "Death's prophetic ear". This
refers to a common superstition that "the veil of the future
is lifted to those near to death". Show how the poet has
broken the order of succession of the pictures. Brunswick's
death is recorded before the breaking up of the ball is
described.</p></div>

<div class='center'><br />Stanza IV</div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>What is the theme? The farewells. What is the emotion?
Fear and anguish. What words show this? "Gathering
tears", "tremblings of distress", "cheeks all pale", "sudden
partings", etc. Give a line in a preceding stanza that expresses
the same thought as "mutual eyes". "Soft eyes
looked love to eyes which spake again."</p></div>

<div class='center'><br />Stanza V</div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>What is described? The muster of the troops. What is
the prevailing feeling? The haste of the soldiers and the
terror of the citizens. How does the poet show this haste?
By the use of such phrases as "hot haste", "mustering
squadron", "clattering car", "impetuous speed", "swiftly
forming", as well as by the rapid movement of the verse.
Why did the citizens of Brussels fear, since they had not to
fight? They dreaded the pillage and ruin which would follow
a French victory. Describe the scene in your own words&mdash;the
cavalry forming in line, the movements of the artillery,
the noise of distant cannon, the "alarming drum", and the
panic of the citizens.</p></div>

<div class='center'><br />Stanza VI</div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The gathering of the Highlanders. Does the poet address
the ear or the eye in this description? Only the sound of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
the bagpipes is described, though it may suggest a picture of
the Highland regiments. What words describe the music?
"Wild and high", "war-note", "thrills savage and shrill".
Why does the poet mention proper names&mdash;"Lochiel",
"Evan", "Donald"? The bagpipes recall stirring memories
of these men, which inspire the clansmen to prove worthy
of their ancestors. What is the "Cameron's gathering"?
The war-song of the Cameron clan. Were there only Camerons
in the Highland regiments? No, the Camerons were only
one famous clan, but are taken here as representative of the
heroism of all the Highlanders. Again, the use of individual
specific cases produces a greater impression than a more
general term. What was the "pibroch"? A wild, irregular
species of music played on the bagpipes, adapted particularly
to rouse a martial spirit among troops going to battle.</p></div>

<div class='center'><br />Stanza VII</div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>What is described in this stanza? The march to the
battle-field. What words show that? "As they pass". They
were going through the forest of "Ardennes". What is the
mood of this stanza? Sadness. The trees are represented as
shedding tears when "Nature" thinks of the sad fate awaiting
so many brave men. What were those tears? The expression
refers to the dew of the early morning on the leaves of the
trees, but the poet has called it "Nature's tear-drops". It
is only a fanciful presentation of a natural phenomenon.
Explain, "if aught inanimate e'er grieves". If inanimate
nature, such as trees or grass, can express sorrow. Nature
cannot grieve, but we appreciate the beauty of the imagery.
Point out a contrast in this stanza. "This fiery mass of living
valour", and "shall moulder cold and low".</p></div>

<div class='center'><br />Stanza VIII</div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>What is the purpose of this stanza? It gives a summary
of the preceding ones. Which stanza corresponds to line 2?
Stanza I. Which corresponds to line 3? Stanzas II, III, and
IV. Which stanzas picture the "marshalling in arms"?
Stanzas V and VI. What stanzas picture "Battle's magnificently<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
stern array"? Stanzas V and VII. Now contrast
all these pictures with the last. The story is epitomized, and
the end described&mdash;"friend, foe,&mdash;in one red burial blent!"</p></div>

<p>The pupils should now read the poem, in order that
the teacher may judge by the varying tones and movements
whether it has been properly appreciated.</p>


<h4><br />THREE SCENES IN THE TYROL</h4>

<div class='center'>(Fourth Reader, page 336)</div>

<h3>AIM</h3>

<p>To lead the pupils to appreciate the thrilling pictures
and to understand the means by which the author has
produced this vividness.</p>


<h3><br />PREPARATION</h3>

<p>The pupils have been required to read this lesson at
their seats or at home.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Where is the Tyrol situated? It is a province in the
Austrian Alps directly east of Switzerland. (Show its position
on the map.)</p>

<p>The mountains are majestic, high, precipitous; the people
daring and independent. The Tyrol is noted for the many
accidents which happen to mountain-climbers. Who are the
chief persons concerned in these three scenes? Maximilian I,
Charles V, and Napoleon.</p>

<p>The author wishes to give, amid the most impressive surroundings,
three stirring events in the lives of three great
Emperors. State briefly the first story. The Emperor Maximilian
was hunting a chamois, when he slipped on the edge
of the precipice, rolled helplessly over, and caught a jutting
ledge of rock, which interrupted his descent. An outlaw
hastened to his assistance and guided him to safety.</p></div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span></p>


<h3><br />PRESENTATION</h3>


<div class='center'>I</div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Yes, this story is often called "The Rescue". Let us note
how the author helps us to see the picture. Where does he
place the spectator? On a "thread-like road" running between
the rocky bank of the Inn River and the foot of the
precipice of the Solstein.</p>

<p>What does the author ask you, as the imaginary spectator,
to do? To throw your head back and look upward.</p>

<p>Why? The precipice towers perpendicularly many hundred
feet above you. He wishes you to imagine you are
standing on this road and the scene is taking place before
your eyes.</p>

<p>What do you see? A hunter in pursuit of a chamois.</p>

<p>Describe this hunter. He is lofty and chivalrous in his
bearing.</p>

<p>What happens? He is bounding on after a chamois toward
the edge of a precipice, when he loses his footing and
falls.</p>

<p>How does the author make you see this plainly? He uses
the present tense, as if the scene were happening now&mdash;"is
bounding", "loses his footing", "rolls helplessly".</p>

<p>Any other way? Yes, he utters exclamations, "Mark!"
"Ah!" Every act is told in the form of an exclamation.</p>

<p>"What is it that arrests him?" This is a question. Does
the author expect an answer? No, he asks the question as I
would ask it of myself if I saw the hunter stopped in his
descent.</p>

<p>Why does he not tell you who this hunter is? I see now
for the first time that it is the great Emperor Maximilian
who is in such peril.</p>

<p>Does any one else see him? Yes, the Abbot, or head of
a neighbouring monastery.</p>

<p>Why does the author mention him? To indicate that,
apparently, human aid could not save the Emperor.</p>

<p>What has been told us in this first paragraph? The peril
of the Emperor.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span></p>

<p>What is told us in the next? His rescue.</p>

<p>Who else sees the danger? Zyps of Zirl.</p>

<p>Who is he? A famous hunter and outlaw.</p>

<p>Do you see him at first? No, I hear his cry. The author
says "Hark! there is a wild cry!" Then I recognize the
outlaw.</p>

<p>Why does he utter the cry? To encourage the Emperor
and let him know there is some one coming to his rescue.</p>

<p>Again how does the author make the picture vivid? By
the use of the present tense, by commands, questions, and
exclamations, and by making the spectator, in his excitement,
address the mountaineer directly; for example, "thou
hunted and hunting outlaw, art thou out upon the heights?"
etc.</p>

<p>By what means does the author show how the outlaw
comes to the Emperor's aid? By comparing him with the
chamois, the insect, and the squirrel. This man combines
in himself all their powers of movement.</p>

<p>What does the spectator now do? He fears that all may
yet be lost, so he shouts to the Emperor to have courage, that
the hunter is coming.</p>

<p>How does the author show his relief from the strain of
the last few moments? His sentences are now longer and
smoother.</p>

<p>How was this event afterwards regarded? The peasants
maintained that an angel came down to their master's rescue.</p>

<p>What does the author seem to think? That his rescue
was due to the interposition of Providence.</p>

<p>What is told in the next paragraph? Zyps' reward.</p>

<p>What did he receive? He was created a Count and received
a pension from the Emperor.</p>

<p>What was his title? "Count Hallooer von Hohenfeldsen."</p>

<p>To what does this refer? To his "wild cry" from the high
peaks, when he saw the Emperor in danger.</p>

<p>How can you prove that this story is true? By inspecting
the pension list of the Royal House of Hapsburg and by
looking at a cross in the mountains that has been erected on
the very spot where Maximilian was rescued.</p></div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span></p>


<div class='center'><br />II</div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Whom do you see in the second vision? The Emperor
Charles V. pursued by his enemies.</p>

<p>Who was he? One of the greatest monarchs in Europe,
greater even than his grandfather, Maximilian I. In this
scene he is ill; his army has met with reverses; he has made
his escape from Innsbruck, the capital of the Tyrol, and is
being conveyed through the mountains to a place of safety,
closely pursued by Maurice of Saxony.</p>

<p>Describe the scene. It is at night, the wind is high, and
is driving the rain against the Emperor's litter, which is
borne by mountaineers and surrounded by his faithful officers.</p>

<p>What is given in the first paragraph? A description of
the storm.</p>

<p>How does the author prepare you for the scene? The
night suggests danger and mystery, and the moon looks out
from a cloud, as though at something taking place in the
gorge. The spectator hears something besides the roar of the
wind.</p>

<p>Select all the words that show what a fearful night it is.
"Night", "dark", "wild", "gusty winds", "howling",
"sheets of blinding rain", "whirling", "hissing eddies",
"rent asunder", "ravings of the tempest".</p>

<p>Notice all the details the author has made use of to convey
the idea of terror and danger.</p>

<p>What is described in the next paragraph? The passage
of the litter through the dark gorge.</p>

<p>Is the spectator forgotten in this scene? No, he first hears
the "tramp of feet", then he sees the torches, and, lastly,
the Emperor's litter surrounded by his attendants.</p>

<p>What words show you the difficulty of their situation?
"Hurried", "crowding", "crushing", "steep and narrow
gorge", "suppressed voices", "fitful glancing of torches",
"anxiously shielded", "mel&eacute;e", "struggle onward".</p>

<p>Why are their voices suppressed? As a natural result
of their perilous position.</p>

<p>Why do they keep their torches burning? To find their
way through the enemy's country amid the dangers by which
they are surrounded.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span></p>

<p>What do the lamps look like? A "constellation" of stars
moving on in the same relative position.</p>

<p>Does the author still refer to the storm? Yes, in "derisive
laughter", "rude wrath of the tempest", and "plumes
streaming on the wind". The author wishes to picture continuously
the fitting surroundings for this adventure, and
so emphasizes these details.</p>

<p>Why does he speak of the "derisive laughter of the
storm"? He compares it to a fiend who mocks the attempts
of man to battle against his power.</p>

<p>Who is described in the third paragraph of this vision?
The Emperor himself.</p>

<p>Why is he not described before, as he is more important
than either the storm or his comrades? The story runs in
a natural order. First are seen the figures surrounding the
litter, and, as it approaches, the Emperor's face is distinguishable.</p>

<p>What is first mentioned in connection with him? His
firmly set teeth.</p>

<p>What does this indicate? His great physical pain, and his
determination of character.</p>

<p>What is mentioned next? His age; he is but fifty-three,
but his wrinkles are deep and his hair turning gray.</p>

<p>What are next described? His forehead, his nose, his eye,
his underlip.</p>

<p>Why does the author picture these features in such detail?
To show the character of the Emperor.</p>

<p>What are we led to infer are some of his characteristics?
A strong intellect, imperious manner, cruelty, and stubborn
pride.</p>

<p>What strong contrast is drawn? The fugitive invalid is
the great Emperor. The author first discusses his illness, his
flight, his suffering in the storm, his adverse fortune, and
then gives him his full titles&mdash;"Emperor of Germany, King
of Spain, Lord of the Netherlands, of Naples, of Lombardy,
and the proud chief of the golden Western World".</p>

<p>Where does the author place the blame for his present
sufferings? On Charles himself, whose sufferings, humiliation,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
and ultimate deliverance were perhaps intended as a
discipline to lead him to repent for past cruelties.</p>

<p>What is described in the last paragraph of this scene?
The escape.</p>

<p>Who is first mentioned? The pursuer, Maurice of Saxony.</p>

<p>Describe him. He is first compared to an "avenger of
blood" in pursuit of a man fleeing to the cities of refuge
referred to in Joshua xx. 3. He is next compared to the
hound relentlessly following his prey.</p>

<p>Who wins in this race? Charles eludes his pursuer.</p>

<p>To whom should he show gratitude for his escape? To
Providence.</p>

<p>Does he acknowledge God's protection? No, he gives all
the credit to his "lucky star".</p>

<p>Explain this. Astrologers had said that the "Star of
Austria" was always at the highest point in the heavens;
and of this favoured House of Austria, Charles was Archduke.</p></div>

<div class='center'><br />III</div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The first scene is called "The Rescue"; the second, "The
Run"; and the last, "The Ruin". What is described in the
last scene? The destruction of the French Army.</p>

<p>Where is the scene laid? In the Tyrol, beside the River
Inn.</p>

<p>What is described in the first paragraph? Bonaparte's
decree that the strongholds of his enemies&mdash;the Tyrolese
warrior hunters&mdash;shall be destroyed.</p>

<p>Why should he wish to do this? The Tyrolese were an
independent people, who would not submit to conscription
and taxation at the hands of the Bavarians.</p>

<p>By what names does the author call Napoleon? "Bonaparte."
That was his surname. The French Emperor had
no hereditary right to the throne, but he wished to be called
Napoleon, instead of Bonaparte, just as we speak of our King
as George V. and rarely refer to his surname of Guelph.</p>

<p>Who advised Napoleon? "His own will is his sole adviser."
He ruled arbitrarily, consulting no one.</p>

<p>What does he do in this case? He sends ten thousand
French and Bavarian soldiers to crush the Tyrolese.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span></p>

<p>Why were the Bavarians taking part in the struggle?
They were at this time allies of France, and Napoleon had
given to their Elector possession of this new but hostile
province.</p>

<p>What does the second paragraph describe? The army
entering the narrow gorge in the mountains.</p>

<p>How does the author give vividness to this picture? He
endows inanimate things such as the "gorge" and the
"river" with human attributes. The "gorge" looks gloomy,
forbidding, and unfriendly, and the "river" seems to roar
indignantly, as though at the attempt of "the mountain
walls" to impede its progress.</p>

<p>The next sentence is in the form of a question and its
answer. Who is supposed to ask this question? This is
the question the leader of the army would ask and the answer
he would make when he discovered the narrow road. The
construction of the sentence suggests the idea of danger.</p>

<p>Why does the next sentence begin with "But"? "But
the glittering array winds on." It suggests that some precautions
for the safety of the army should have been
observed; but it may have been impossible to take these precautions,
and the orders of Bonaparte had to be obeyed at
all hazards.</p>

<p>What is described in the next sentence? The author gives
full details of the progress of this imposing army. The
River Inn seems to share the feelings of the Tyrolese themselves
and protest angrily against this invasion by a foreign
power.</p>

<p>How is the next sentence related to the preceding? "But"
marks a contrast. The noise of the army and the river is
contrasted with the silence on the heights.</p>

<p>Why are the "eagles" mentioned? The silence is rendered
more impressive by the occasional "shrill cry" of the eagles,
and the "wings" of the eagles hovering above are an omen
of the coming disaster which is to overtake "the gilded
eagles of France" below.</p>

<p>What is described in the next paragraph? The "voice"
from the "heights".<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span></p>

<p>How does the author make this paragraph impressive?
As he wishes to indicate the critical moment, he still uses
the present tense, direct narration, short sentences, exclamation,
and interrogation; he suggests, through a mysterious
voice far up the heights, that supernatural agents are at
work. The army, in its helpless length, is compared to an
"uncoiled serpent".</p>

<p>What is the subject of the next paragraph? The destruction
of the entire army.</p>

<p>How is this ruin accomplished? Unseen in the heights
above, the Tyrolese peasantry hurl down rocks, roots, and
trunks of pine trees, as well as sending a "deadly hail" from
their rifles along the "whole line" of the defenceless army
below.</p>

<p>Notice the richness of detail. What words help to make
the description of their destruction more vivid? "Bounding",
"thundering", "gathering speed", "headlong way",
"launched down", "powerless foe", "deadly hail", "fearful
storm", "crushed to death", "tumbled, horse and man, into
the choked and swollen river".</p>

<p>Notice the contrast of this paragraph with the picture
in the second paragraph of this vision of the gallant invading
army.</p>

<p>What is the subject of the last paragraph? The reflections
of the author.</p>

<p>Of what does he speak? Of the wonders and beauties of
creation and the sad power that man possesses of spoiling
and staining these wonders by giving rein to his own "evil
ambitions and fierce revenges".</p>

<p>How has he emphasized this? By the use of exclamation,
question, ellipses, and the mention of the "serpent" as the
symbol of evil.</p>

<p>How does the interrogative form of the sentence give it
vividness? Contrast the effect of saying, "Who would willingly
linger on the hideous details?" with "No one would
willingly linger", etc. The author does not expect an answer,
he throws the sentence into the question form for the
rhetorical effect. The reader pays more attention to the
thought by trying to find an answer to the question.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span></p>

<p>What is the value of the ellipses in "Sorrowful that man
... should come"? It is stronger than saying, "It
is sorrowful that man ... should come". The subject
and verb are omitted, as they are not strong words, and
"Sorrowful" is placed in the most prominent position on
account of its importance.</p></div>

<h3><br />SUMMARY</h3>

<div class="blockquot"><p>In these three pictures, what is the constant element?
The scene used as the background. All three visions take
place in the Tyrol, two of them on the banks of the Inn
River. They are three companion pictures of this historic
mountain province.</p>

<p>How does this style compare with that which you find in
other lessons? It is abrupt and abounds in many rhetorical
forms&mdash;ellipses, use of the present tense, exclamation, direct
address, and accumulation of details.</p>

<p>Would it be suitable for all prose expression? No; it is
impassioned prose, full of emotion and picturesque detail.
The smoother, more regulated sentence-structure, such as is
in place in ordinary narration, would be too cold for these
descriptions. On the other hand, this style is not suitable
for expressing a quiet mood or giving a clear explanation.
It is too turbulent, and would pall upon the reader if continued
at too great length, but it is often very suitable in an
oratorical selection.</p></div>

<p>The pupils should finally read the lesson aloud, to show
how they have appreciated the story.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII</h2>

<h3>SUPPLEMENTARY READING</h3>


<p>Before studying these lessons in supplementary reading,
it is suggested that the teacher read again what has been
said on "Extensive Reading", p. 39 of this Manual.</p>


<h4><br />SOUTH-WEST WIND, ESQ.</h4>

<div class='center'>(Third Reader, page 86)</div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>You have read the story of South-West Wind, Esq., in the
Third Reader.</p>

<p>Who were the persons mentioned in this story? Three
brothers, Schwartz, Hans, and Gluck.</p>

<p>What were their characters? Schwartz and Hans were
rich but very miserly; they were quarrelsome, drunken, and
cruel. Gluck was kind, polite, and unselfish.</p>

<p>How did Gluck show these qualities? He admitted the
stranger into the house for shelter from the rain, when he
knew his brothers would punish him for so doing; he asked
politely to take the stranger's cloak, when the water dripping
from it was putting the fire out; and he offered him his
share of the mutton, although he knew it meant that he must
go without his own supper.</p>

<p>When the older brothers returned what did they do? They
tried to punish Gluck and to force the stranger out of the
house.</p>

<p>What happened? They were hurled to the ground by the
stranger, who was much stronger than they supposed.</p>

<p>What other punishment did they receive? The roof was
blown off the house while they slept, and their beautiful
valley, together with their crops and cattle, was utterly
destroyed by the heavy rains.</p>

<p>Who was the stranger? He left his card with "South-West
Wind, Esq." written on it.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span></p>

<p>Now the story in the Reader is only the first chapter of a
longer story, which relates what fortune came to the three
brothers. What should you expect would happen to them? I
should expect that Schwartz and Hans would have more
troubles, and that Gluck would be rewarded for his kind-heartedness.</p></div>

<div class='center'><br />CHAPTER II</div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Read the second chapter of this longer story called <i>The
King of the Golden River</i>.</p>

<p>Give me the main points in this chapter?</p>

<div class='poem3'>
1. The valley was turned into a desert.<br />
2. The brothers became goldsmiths.<br />
3. The mug<br />
4. Gluck's wish that the river would turn into gold<br />
5. The voice from the furnace<br />
6. The dwarf<br />
7. The King told Gluck how the river could be turned into gold.<br />
</div>

<p>What are the characters of the two brothers in this
chapter? They were very dishonest and even tried to mix
copper with the gold. They were drunken and wasted their
money, and they were lazy and cruel.</p>

<p>Describe the mug that was being melted. It had been
given to them by their uncle, and Gluck was very fond of it.
It was made of gold almost in the form of a human face.
The face was fierce and red, the eyes were bright, the beard
and whiskers were of fine gold, and the hair was of fine spun
gold, forming the handle of the mug.</p>

<p>While the mug was being melted in the furnace, what
did Gluck see as he looked out of the window? The range
of mountains overhanging Treasure Valley, with the mountain
tops shining in the sunset.</p>

<p>This is a lovely description of a sunset in the mountains.
Pick out the details of the picture. "Rocks ... all crimson
and purple with the sunset", "bright tongues of fiery cloud",
"the river ... a waving column of pure gold", "the double
arch of a broad purple rainbow", "flushing and fading
alternately in the wreaths of spray".<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span></p>

<p>What words suggest colours? "Crimson", "purple",
"fiery", "pure gold", "purple rainbow", "flushing",
"fading".</p>

<p>What did this picture suggest to Gluck? It made him
wish that the river were really gold.</p>

<p>Describe the dwarf who came out of the furnace. He was
a foot and a half high; his hair and beard were long, curled,
and delicate, and his face was copper-coloured.</p>

<p>Account for the dwarf being in such a place. It was
owing to the malicious enchantment of a king stronger than
himself that he had been turned into the golden mug, and,
when the mug was melted, Gluck poured out the metal, and,
thus freed the King of the Golden River from the power of
his enemy.</p>

<p>How did the King show his gratitude? He told Gluck
how the river could be turned into gold.</p>

<p>What must Gluck do in order to gain this end? He must
climb to the top of the mountain and cast three drops of
holy water into the stream at its source.</p></div>

<div class='center'><br />CHAPTER III</div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>What are the main facts in this chapter?</p>

<div class='hang2'>
1. The brothers returned and beat Gluck because the mug was a total loss.</div>
<div class='hang2'>2. Schwartz and Hans fought.</div>
<div class='hang2'>3. Schwartz was arrested.</div>
<div class='hang2'>4. Hans stole a cupful of holy water.</div>
<div class='hang2'>5. Hans taunted Schwartz.</div>
<div class='hang2'>6. Hans attempted to change the river to gold. (1) The dog; (2) the fair child; (3) the old man.</div>
<div class='hang2'>7. Hans was changed into the Black Stone.</div>


<p>What characteristics of the older brothers are shown in
this chapter? They were drunken, brutal, quarrelsome, dishonest,
malicious, and selfish.</p>

<p>Why are the dog, the child, and the old man introduced
into the story? To show how indifferent Hans was to the
suffering of animals, children, and aged people. The sight
of these helpless creatures should have aroused his pity.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span></p>

<p>Were there any indications in the story that Hans would
be unsuccessful? Yes, there was "a strange shadow"; the
air "seemed to throw his blood into a fever"; "a dark gray
cloud came over the sun"; "long, snake-like shadows";
"leaden weight of the dead air"; "flash of blue lightning";
"tongues of fire"; "flashes of bloody light".</p>

<p>Why was Hans unsuccessful? He had led a bad life, had
been dishonest, and had been selfish to the dog, the child,
and the aged man.</p>

<p>Show that it was an appropriate punishment that Hans
should be turned into a Black Stone. His heart was as hard
as stone, and his deeds were black.</p></div>

<div class='center'><br />CHAPTER IV</div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>What is the main theme of this chapter? Schwartz's
attempt to turn the river into gold.</p>

<p>What are the chief incidents recorded?</p>

<div class='hang2'>
1. Gluck paid Schwartz's fine.</div>
<div class='hang2'>2. Schwartz refused water to the child, the old man, and to the spirit of Hans.</div>
<div class='hang2'>3. He was also changed to a Black Stone.</div>


<p>What were the indications that Schwartz would be unsuccessful?
There was a "black cloud rising out of the
West"; "a mist of the colour of blood"; "waves of the angry
sea"; "bursts of spiry lightning"; "the sky was like ...
a lake of blood"; "its waves were black, like thunderclouds";
"their foam was like fire"; "the lightning glared
into his eyes".</p></div>

<div class='center'><br />CHAPTER V</div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>What is the theme in the last chapter? Gluck's attempt
to turn the river into gold.</p>

<p>Give the main incidents.</p>

<div class='hang2'>
1. The priest gave him holy water.</div>
<div class='hang2'>2. He gave water to the aged man and the child.</div>
<div class='hang2'>3. He gave his last drop of water to the dying dog.</div>
<div class='hang2'><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>4. The dog was transformed into the King of the Golden River.</div>
<div class='hang2'>5. He gave Gluck three drops of dew.</div>
<div class='hang2'>6. Gluck cast the water into the river.</div>
<div class='hang2'>7. Treasure Valley again became a fertile garden, and Gluck became very rich.</div>


<p>What were the indications that Gluck would be successful?
After giving the old man some water, the "path became
easier"; "grasshoppers began singing"; there was "bright
green moss"; "pale pink starry flowers"; "soft belled
gentians"; "pure white transparent lilies"; "its waves
were as clear as crystal".</p>

<p>What strong contrast is brought out in this story? There is
a contrast between this chapter and the two preceding ones.
Gluck's conduct is so different from that of Schwartz and
Hans; and the aspect of nature, as it appears to him, is very
different from the scenes viewed by his brothers.</p>

<p>Describe Treasure Valley after it was changed. The
"fresh grass sprang beside the new streams"; "creeping
plants grew"; "young flowers opened"; "thickets of myrtle
and tendrils of vine cast lengthening shadows"; "his barns
became full of corn and his house of treasure".</p>

<p>Why did Gluck deserve so much kindness? He had been
hospitable to South-West Wind, Esq.; had suffered hunger
and punishment on his account; had been industrious; had
freed the King of the Golden River from his enchantment;
had obeyed his instructions; had felt sorry for Hans; had
paid Schwartz's fine; and had shown mercy to animals and
helpless people.</p>

<p>Was there anything said about the two older brothers?
Yes, there are two black stones, which people still call "The
Black Brothers", at the top of the cataract. This story tells
how these stones came to be there.</p></div>


<h4><br />A CHRISTMAS CAROL</h4>

<div class='center'>(Fourth Reader, page 39)</div>

<p>The pupils have read <i>Scrooge's Christmas</i>, in the
Fourth Reader. They have also read the synopsis of <i>A
Christmas Carol</i> at the beginning of the lesson. If they<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
have read the first four <i>staves</i> of the carol in a general way,
they will be in a better position to study intensively the
last stave, or chapter, which is the lesson in the Reader.
They will understand the causes that have changed this
"covetous old sinner" to the man "who knew how to
keep Christmas Day well". This lesson should be taken
up near Christmas. The pupils will discuss Stave I, after
having read it at home.</p>

<div class='center'><br />Stave I</div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>What is the title of this work? A Christmas Carol.</p>

<p>Why is it called a carol? In England, it is the custom for
bands of singers, called "waits", to go from house to house
on Christmas Eve. The author calls this ghost story of
Christmas a carol in prose, for it pictures the joys and
sorrows of this season.</p>

<p>What does a stave mean? It keeps up the idea of a carol.
Each chapter is called a stave, or stanza of the carol.</p>

<p>What is the title of the first stave? "Marley's Ghost."</p>

<p>Who was Marley? He had been Scrooge's partner, but was
now dead. He had been as miserly as Scrooge himself.</p>

<p>Where is the scene laid? In London.</p>

<p>When? On Christmas Eve.</p>

<p>Describe Scrooge. "Oh but he was a tight-fisted hand
... one degree at Christmas". (See Stave I of <i>A Christmas
Carol</i>.)</p>

<p>Notice the wonderful accumulation of strong adjectives
and phrases in this description. Why does the author use
so many? He wishes to emphasize the cold miserliness of this
man.</p>

<p>What is the first incident? Scrooge's treatment of his
nephew, who has invited him to dinner on Christmas Day.</p>

<p>What does this incident show? His churlishness, and his
contempt for those who spend money freely.</p>

<p>What is the next incident? His refusal to subscribe to
any charities in the city.</p>

<p>What comes next? The account of his treatment of Bob
Cratchit.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span></p>

<p>What does this show? His meanness and tyranny.</p>

<p>When he returns from his supper, what does he encounter?
Marley's Ghost.</p>

<p>What does the ghost tell him? How it must wander
through the world without rest, in atonement for Marley's
cruelties and his neglect of other people. It laments his
misspent life.</p>

<p>What does it promise to do to Scrooge? It promises to
send him "Three Spirits".</p>

<p>What good description is found in Stave I? Besides the
character sketch of Scrooge, there is a picture of Christmas
Eve in the London streets, in the paragraph beginning
"Meanwhile the fog and darkness thickened".</p></div>

<div class='center'><br />Stave II</div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>What is described in this chapter? The visit of the first
spirit.</p>

<p>What was it? The "Ghost of Christmas Past".</p>

<p>Read me a description of it. "It was a strange figure ... like
a child ... which it held under its arm".</p>

<p>What does the spirit do? It forces Scrooge to accompany
it and shows him former Christmas scenes in his life.</p>

<p>What are these scenes? Scrooge as a solitary boy at
school; his boyhood stories, <i>Ali Baba</i> and <i>Robinson Crusoe;</i>
his sister; Fezziwig's ball; Scrooge's sweetheart; scenes in
her married life.</p>

<p>What is the mood of these different scenes? There is
humour, and a great deal of fun, as well as some pathos. It
is all told in a lively style.</p>

<p>What are the best descriptions? Fezziwig's ball, and the
remembrance of the scenes in <i>Ali Baba</i>.</p></div>

<div class='center'><br />Stave III</div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>What is told in this chapter? The visit of the second
spirit.</p>

<p>Who was it? The "Spirit of Christmas Present".</p>

<p>What does it show Scrooge? Scenes of Christmas shopping;
Christmas out-of-doors; the Grocers; Bob Cratchit's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
family, the goose, their dinner, the puddings; the miner's
home; the lighthouse keepers; the sailors; Scrooge's nephew
at home&mdash;blindman's bluff, forfeits, Yes and No; vision of
"Ignorance" and "Want".</p>

<p>What do all these scenes go to show? How different kinds
of people keep Christmas; how kind and merry most people
are at this season of the year: and how some have to struggle
in order to get this one day's pleasure.</p>

<p>Select some examples of humour. Peter's conceit, some
of the descriptions of the grocery stores, the anticipations
lest harm befall the goose and the pudding.</p>

<p>Select any examples of pathos. The references to Tiny
Tim.</p>

<p>Select and read the best descriptions. The grocery stores,
the fruit stores, the goose, the pudding.</p></div>

<div class='center'><br />Stave IV</div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>What is told in this chapter? The visit of the third spirit.</p>

<p>What was it? The "Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come".</p>

<p>What does it show Scrooge? A vision of his death&mdash;how
he is plundered by laundress, charwoman, and undertaker;
the phantom of Death; Scrooge's creditors; the grave.</p>

<p>Had these scenes actually taken place? No, but they will
be realized if Scrooge does not change his manner of thinking
and living.</p>

<p>What is the effect of these three visions? Scrooge promises
the "Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come" "I will honour
Christmas in my heart and try to keep it all the year".</p>

<p>Why are the scenes in this chapter not so pleasant as
those that the two former spirits had shown him? The scenes
that the first spirit had brought before him were his joys at
the Christmas season before he had hardened his heart;
those that the second spirit had shown were scenes in the
lives of people who do something for others and enjoy themselves
in the true Christmas spirit; those that the last spirit
had shown were the sordid scenes which would be sure to
come if he did not change his attitude toward life. The last
scenes shown him by the third spirit furnish a strong contrast
to the others.</p></div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span></p>


<div class='center'><br />Stave V</div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>What does this chapter relate? How Scrooge actually kept
Christmas Day.</p>

<p>What were the other chapters about? The first and the
last were the only chapters where he was awake. Chapters
Two, Three, and Four are visions or dreams. Notice how the
phantom changed into the bed-post.</p>

<p>This chapter should be studied closely. Who wrote this
story? Charles Dickens, an English novelist.</p>

<p>Do you know any other good stories by the same author?
<i>David Copperfield</i>, <i>The Pickwick Papers</i>, <i>Nicholas Nickleby</i>.</p>

<p>Yes, we have had extracts in the Readers from these books.</p>

<p>What lessons are they? <i>The Pickwick Club on the Ice</i>,
in the <i>Third Book;</i> <i>David Copperfield's First Journey Alone</i>,
and <i>The Indignation of Nicholas Nickleby</i> in the <i>Fourth
Book</i>.</p>

<p>Some day you must read these stories. <i>David Copperfield</i>
tells us a great deal about Dickens' early days. <i>The Pickwick
Papers</i> is full of humour in scenes such as that depicted in
<i>The Pickwick Club on the Ice</i>, and has some fine characters
in it, and <i>Nicholas Nickleby</i> gives a vivid picture of the
brutality existing in some schools in England at the time the
book was written.</p></div>


<h4><br />THE LADY OF THE LAKE</h4>

<div class='center'>(Fourth Reader, page 270)</div>

<p>The pupils will have read the account of the stirring
combat between Fitz-James and Roderick Dhu. They will
be curious to know the circumstances that led up to this
combat and also the conclusion of the story.</p>

<p>The aim of the teacher is to lead the pupils to appreciate
the construction of the story, the fine character
sketches, and the descriptions of natural scenery, as well
as to give them an impression of Highland life. The
pupils will take delight in the rapid movement of the
verse and in the deeds of valour.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span></p>

<p>Some passages should be dwelt upon at greater length
by the teacher, and others more lightly touched upon, so
that the connections of the various parts will be understood.
A close and tedious consideration of all the lines
would not show a good critical taste, as some passages are
very fine, while others have only ordinary merit.</p>

<p>The teacher should disclose the identity of Fitz-James
as James V of Scotland and should explain the cause of
the exile of the Douglas Family. He should also sketch
the life of rebellion and consequent outlawry led by some
of the Highland clans before they were reduced to submission.</p>

<div class='center'><br />CANTO I</div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The teacher should study with the pupils the Invocation
of the three opening stanzas and ask them to read the first
canto. He should next discuss it briefly, as suggested in the
following outline:</p>

<p>What are the main divisions of the first canto?</p>

<div class='poem'>
1. The chase<br />
2. Description of the Trossachs<br />
3. Description of Ellen Douglas<br />
4. Description of Fitz-James.<br />
</div>

<p>Why is the story of the chase introduced? It brings Fitz-James
alone into the enemy's country, where he meets Ellen
Douglas, and prepares the way for the adventures that follow.</p>

<p>What is the story of the chase? The hundred huntsmen
and the horses and the dogs become wearied in the long
pursuit after the stag. One huntsman alone is left to enter
the deep ravine where the stag escapes.</p>

<p>This description of the Trossachs made the spot famous,
and ever since it has been a favourite resort of tourists.</p></div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span></p>


<div class='center'><br />CANTO II<br />
The Island</div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>What are the divisions of this canto?</p>

<div class='poem2'>
1. The departure of the huntsmen<br />
2. Description of the minstrel<br />
3. The story of Roderick's love<br />
4. Return of the Clan-Alpine<br />
5. Malcolm Graeme<br />
6. The quarrel.<br />
</div>

<p>What is the value of this canto? It explains many facts
that we did not understand. Among others, it shows us the
relation of the Douglases to the King and to Roderick Dhu.
It tells of the love of Malcolm Graeme for Ellen and of
Roderick's hopeless love for her. It shows us Roderick's noble
traits of character and the fearful cruelties of which he is
capable. He cannot possibly win Ellen's love.</p></div>

<div class='center'>CANTO III<br />
The Gathering</div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>What are the main divisions of this canto?</p>

<div class='poem2'>
1. Roderick's determination to renew hostilities<br />
2. Brian the Hermit<br />
3. The ceremony<br />
4. The message of the Fiery Cross<br />
5. Roderick's devotion to Ellen<br />
6. The gathering.<br />
</div>

<p>What are the best passages in this canto?</p>

<div class='poem2'>
1. Description of Loch Katrine<br />
2. The coronach<br />
3. Hymn to the Virgin.<br />
</div>

<p>Why are funeral and wedding scenes introduced? These
serve to show how the message of the Fiery Cross was looked
upon as more important than even death or marriage.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span></p>

<p>What insight into the life of the clansmen is furnished in
this canto?</p>

<div class='hang2'>
1. The superstition of the Highlanders. This is shown in Brian's faith and in the weird ceremonies in connection with the Fiery Cross.</div>
<div class='hang2'>2. The method of mustering the clans by means of the message of the Fiery Cross.</div>
<div class='hang2'>3. Their funerals and weddings.<br />
</div>

<p>Notice also the vigour of the stanzas that describe the
flight of Malise.</p></div>

<div class='center'><br />CANTO IV<br />The Prophecy</div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Give the main themes in this canto.</p>

<div class='poem2'>
1. Return of Malise<br />
2. Norman's guard<br />
3. The augury and the prophecy<br />
4. Return of Fitz-James to Ellen Douglas<br />
5. The ring<br />
6. Blanche of Devan<br />
7. Death of Murdoch<br />
8. Fitz-James meets Roderick Dhu.<br />
</div>

<p>What are the best stanzas? The ballad of "Alice Brand".</p>

<p>Why is this ballad introduced? It shows the character
of Scottish minstrelsy, the belief in the world of fairies, and
the lesson of hope that at the darkest moment the hour of
happiness may be near. It furnishes another example of
Allanbane's prophetic insight.</p>

<p>The introduction: "The rose is fairest when it is budding
new." Why is this stanza appropriate? It shows the tenderness
of Norman's love, as contrasted with the fierce warfare
in which he is engaged.</p>

<p>Why is Blanche of Devan introduced? To furnish an
example of Roderick's cruelty, so that Fitz-James should feel
justified in punishing him. Blanche of Devan also warns
Fitz-James of Murdoch's treachery. This stanza explains the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
allusions in the lesson in the <i>Fourth Book</i>, for example: "a
braid of your fair lady's hair", and "There lies red Murdoch
stark and stiff".</p>

<p>What characteristics of Roderick are shown in the canto?</p>

<div class='poem2'>
1. His care for the defenceless in his clan<br />
2. His cruelty to his enemies<br />
3. His hospitality<br />
4. His superstition.<br />
</div>

<p>What was the prophecy?</p>

<div class='poem'>
Who spills the foremost foeman's life<br />
That party conquers in the strife.<br />
</div>

<p>What is the value of the prophecy in the poem? It
furnishes a reason for the eagerness of the clansmen to take
the life of the huntsman, as the former would then "conquer
in the strife".</p></div>

<div class='center'>CANTO V
<br />The Combat</div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Give the main events in this canto.</p>

<div class='poem2'>
1. Roderick guides Fitz-James to neutral ground<br />
2. The combat<br />
3. Douglas surrenders<br />
4. The games<br />
5. The popularity of Douglas.<br />
</div>

<p>What is the most striking part of this canto? The story
of the combat.</p>

<p>Why? It is a fine example of Scottish bravery and
chivalry.</p>

<p>What Scottish characteristics are found in this canto?</p>

<div class='poem2'>
1. The character of Scottish games in the city<br />
2. The fickleness of the mob<br />
3. The chivalrous conduct of the combatants.<br />
</div></div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span></p>


<div class='center'><br />CANTO VI<br />
The Guard-room</div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>What are the main themes in this canto?</p>

<div class='poem2'>
1. The rough soldiers<br />
2. Ellen presents the ring<br />
3. The battle of Beal' an Duine<br />
4. Death of Roderick<br />
5. Ellen's request to James<br />
6. Happiness of the Douglases and of Malcolm Graeme<br />
7. Farewell to the Harp.<br />
</div>

<p>Why are the rough soldiers introduced? This passage
furnishes a good description of the character of the soldiers,
and shows the power of Ellen's quiet dignity and modesty.</p>

<p>What is the value of the battle of Beal' an Duine? It
affords an opportunity to the valiant Roderick to imagine
himself in battle, so that when death comes he does not
realize that it finds him a prisoner and his clan vanquished.</p>

<p>How does the poem end? Ellen, her father, and Malcolm
Graeme are united and happy, and Fitz-James reveals his
identity and shows his magnanimity.</p>

<p>What should be read in connection with the last three
stanzas? The first three stanzas of the poem. They are an
Invocation to Scottish minstrelsy. We now have the Farewell.</p>

<p>Which cantos do you consider are the best? The first and
the fifth.</p>

<p>Why? The first contains such wonderful word-pictures
and the fifth seems to be the crisis of the story. The interest
is not sustained in the sixth canto, as one knows matters are
sure to be adjusted.</p></div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span></p>

Through the brown mould,<br />
Although the March breezes blew keen on her face,<br />
Although the white snow lay on many a place.<br />
I can't do much yet, but I'll do what I can.<br />
It's well I began!<br />
For unless I can manage to lift up my head,<br />
The people will think that the Spring herself's dead.<br />
O Daffydowndilly, so brave and so true,<br />
I wish all were like you!<br />
So ready for duty in all sorts of weather,<br />
And holding forth courage and beauty together.<br />
